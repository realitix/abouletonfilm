Il fait appel \u00e0 un sp\u00e9cialiste en sciences occultes, ce qui ne manque d'effrayer les villageois.

The truth is that it's a bold and ambitious picture, a tricky narrative of mental health, incest and brutal patriarch pressure, all cloaked in the Hammer traits so prevalent in their 70s productions.\r\n\r\nCue blood and nudity, hammy acting, good acting, splendid costumes, vivid colour and a mansion setting of some distinction. Unfortunately the story remains too vague for too long, it never settles into a rhythm to unsettle the viewer, while the poor acting from the principals playing the family (Robert Hardy, Shane Briant and Gillian Hills) destracts from what is on paper a fascinating screenplay.\r\n\r\nThere's something for every horror fan in here, even though it's not explicitly a horror film, so roll the dice and take your chance. I'll sit on the fence like a Swiss politician and rate it 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [42735, 39925, 86643, 39924]}
