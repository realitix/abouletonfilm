When he arrives in the underground garage below his apartment block he finds a car on fire with a dead man inside. He also finds himself being filmed. He takes the video upstairs to his home and watches a man do ordinary things like shave etc before covering himself in petrol and setting himself and his car alight. Procter becomes a driven man as he tries to unearth what drove this person to kill himself in such an unusual manner.
