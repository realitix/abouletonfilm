What was originally a test of individual survival in a team up environment has evolved into a survival of the fittest.  The Survivor Series is no longer a \"team sport.\" No one plays nice on this field! No one gets Gatorade dumped on his head! It's about kicking ass and taking names!  Witness history in the making with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Mankind, Owen Hart, Kane and many, many more!  Tell that announcer where he can stick his six-legged turkey!  The Survivor Series makes football seem like a card game!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5F494k2SkGpQZivVPZ20FVgkCw2.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Austin ()", "Mark William Calaway ()", "Bret Hart ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
