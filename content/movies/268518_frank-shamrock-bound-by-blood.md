There's a lot of story to tell (Spike producers said they bandied the fighter's 2012 memoirs around the office to begin), but wisely, Shamrock focuses mostly on Frank's deteriorated relationship with his iconic brother Ken. Frank and Ken, a weathered UFC Hall of Famer still trying to ply his trade at age 49, haven't spoken in nearly 15 years.\r ...\r For MMA enthusiasts, Shamrock will be an enlightening hour. It also takes a more serious tone than Spike's previous MMA programming. But at its heart, Shamrock is not about MMA. It's about love and hurt, and finding forgiveness and acceptance in the face of dysfunction. For Frank, on his own road of self-improvement, it was about finding peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f3e8UfxYFwBW8L3HW35LWwyDv3o.jpg", "actors": ["Bas Rutten (Himself)", "Frank Shamrock (Himself)", "Tito Ortiz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OiUMy0o3IlE"}
