Ice Man or not, Albert was on fire the night of his taping on October 28, 1991. His performance was a wild ride, and the ACL stage proved too small for his antics, so with his long guitar chord in tow he took off into the audience during his ten-minute-plus finale of Frosty. He was first and foremost an entertainer, but nonetheless belongs up front in the pantheon of great blues guitarists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yeqseJSTmqoHQndFe7LlGaXAGyF.jpg", "actors": ["Albert Collins (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
