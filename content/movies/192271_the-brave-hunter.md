Sennett looks quite dashing as the big game hunter. He's quite comically cowardly when the real big game shows up. Mabel is so calm and natural with the bear that she appears like a goddess or other worldly creature. She acts as if she's doing the scene with a cat or dog.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mack Sennett (The Brave Hunter)", "Dell Henderson (The Brave Hunter's Rival)", "Mabel Normand (The Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
