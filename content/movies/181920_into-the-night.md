Bo vanishes from the story, and Eric only comes back at the end. Then we cut to Wu Ma coming home with a wrapped gift for his wife, whom he catches in the act with her lover. The lover kills the husband, who becomes a ghost. Then a bunch of young women are working as bar hostesses, chatting to some guys.
