The movie is notable in that the opening act starts out as a light-hearted romantic comedy, but at the 30 minute mark turns into a dramatic tragedy. Like a number of P. Ramlee's works, the film criticizes the unofficial caste system that separates the wealthy from the poor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m2HikbvG0BD1fHNLqSzXNtcDtbe.jpg", "actors": ["P.
