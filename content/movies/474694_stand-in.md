They are looking for locations for the remake of an American film in which a man swims his way home, passing through the houses and pools that he finds along the route. Corrado is the stand in used to test the shots, locations and the swimming pools in which the lead will be filmed. While we watch his attempts to get into the part, the real actors and a real crew burst onto the scene, on a set in which no one is in the right place. A film with a crisis of identity, in a surreal search for itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/himDZNEqpzza698vJjJLi7CucVU.jpg", "actors": ["Filippo Timi ()", "Valeria Golino ()", "Nadia Kounda ()", "Younes Bouab ()", "Corrado Sassi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
