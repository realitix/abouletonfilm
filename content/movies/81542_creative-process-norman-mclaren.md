He produced sixty films in a stunning range of styles and techniques, collecting over 200 international awards, and world recognition. In Creative Process, director Donald McWilliams demystifies the process of artistic creation. Drawing on McLaren's private film vaults, a gold mine of experimental footage and uncompleted films, McWilliams explores McLaren's methods, including his celebrated \"pixillation\" technique, and his daring forays into animated surrealism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3cxLcyETyApJS1BamN1UTDUIIPr.jpg", "actors": ["Norman McLaren (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
