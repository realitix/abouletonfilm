She sees the family physician, Dr. Swope, first and then hires a private detective. Her own sleuthing is more effective and she devises a plan; having long been pursued by Eric, she apparently accedes and accompanies him to an apartment and, per her plan, enter the wrong one. There, they find Carol's best friend, Charlotte, and John hiding in a closet. The latter, showing more nerve than good sense, goes into a rage and berates Carol for her apparent philandering. The battle continues at home, where their daughter Janet informs them that because of them, she and Paul have given up on the idea of marriage, but are going away together, anyway. Carol and John trail them to a hotel and find them in twin beds, whereupon John, armed with a fire-ax, summons a justice of the peace and demands a fire-ax version of a shotgun wedding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w7d7gep5H8PxKq823MBdmu5F2Wg.jpg", "actors": ["Genevieve Tobin (Carol)", "Adolphe Menjou (John)", "Mary Astor (Charlotte)", "Edward Everett Horton (Eric)", "Patricia Ellis (Janet)", "Guy Kibbee (Justice Of The Peace)", "Hugh Herbert (Detective)", "Paul Kaye (Paul Smith)", "Hobart Cavanaugh (Hotel desk clerk)", "Robert Greig (Andrews)", "Harold Waldridge (Elevator Boy)", "Leila Bennett (Hotel Maid (uncredited))", "Virginia Dabney (Girl in Elevator (uncredited))", "Ann Hovey (Hat Check Girl (uncredited))", "Symona Boniface (Roulette Table Player (uncredited))", "Miki Morita (Miki - Eric's Servant (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [123909], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
