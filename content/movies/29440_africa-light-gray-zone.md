The name suggests romance, the beauty of nature and promises a life without any problems in a country where the difference between rich and poor could hardly be greater. Namibia does not give that impression of it. If you look at its surface it seems like Africa in its most innocent and civilized form. It is a country that is so inviting to dream by its spectacular landscape, stunning scenery and fascinating wildlife. It has a very strong tourism structure and the government gets a lot of money with its magical attraction. But despite its grandiose splendor it is an endless gray zone as well. It oscillates between tradition and modernity, between the cattle in the country and the slums in the city. It shuttles from colonial times, land property reform to minimum wage for everyone. It fluctuates between socialism and cold calculated market economy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3nv15sYjw0XM3x9b8DaCTv6m0Xq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [26224, 26214, 26163], "youtube_key": "_Z_09uRZU-Y"}
