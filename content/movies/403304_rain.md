Inspired by the \"punk\" incarnation of the Marvel superhero Storm of the X-Men. Influenced by the more dystopian stories of the X-Men franchise as well as the seminal comic LifeDeath by Chris Claremont and Barry Windsor-Smith, this original story takes a broken mutant hero \"Rain\" from the lowest depths of despair into the darker recesses of her own shattered memory. If she is to survive, she must discover a new identity and somehow rediscover her lost power.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v11IuVNSIfE0P6rYiIfPLm9fPeB.jpg", "actors": ["Debo Adejobi (The Wakandan)", "Sayward Anderson (Doctor)", "Ben Broussard (Streetpunk 3)", "Gemmila Cadd (The Child)", "Chris Cude (MNI Guard)", "Chris Cude (MNI Guard)", "Maya Glick (Rain)", "Zachary Gossett (Streetpunk 1)", "Gray Haddock (J.
