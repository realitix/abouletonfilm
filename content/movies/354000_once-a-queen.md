In 1935 the tree-lined avenues were of such splendour that the council of the day decided to hold a festival to celebrate the blossoming of the trees and the arrival of spring. This program shows how this festival has become an annual event that includes the crowing of The Jacaranda Queen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bqiRMdcZwCPWKTzYQwxY0zyL0B9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
