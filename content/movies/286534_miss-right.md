He plays Terry Bartell, a U.P.I. reporter stationed in Rome. Bartell is an inveterate ladies man who suddenly decides he's through playing meaningless romantic games and wants to find \"Miss Right.\" As a prelude to beginning the search, he sets up a series of \"farewell\" dinners with his three current girlfriends, scheduled in his apartment in two hour intervals. Most of the film consists of these lengthy encounters, including one with veteran Italian actress Virna Lisi, playing an older married woman. Karen Black is another of the ladies, who arrives by jet for a midnight rendezvous and is unpleasantly surprised.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uVEZUC8PVW2hGN7p827M82j2TLr.jpg", "actors": ["William Tepper (Terry Bartell)", "Margot Kidder (Juliette)", "Karen Black (Amy)", "Virna Lisi (Anna)", "Marie-France Pisier (BeBe)", "Clio Goldsmith ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
