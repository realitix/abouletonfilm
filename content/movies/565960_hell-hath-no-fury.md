Loretta Swit looks like she had even more plastic surgery than Barbara Eden, but both give an authentic performance within the realms of the everyday-fantastic. The ending is a necessity but not as predictable as other TV-movie fare. Thoroughly ridiculous, thoroughly enjoyable and a fun story."}], "recommandations_id": []}
