Made entirely from archive photographs and footage from the earliest days of moving image, All This Can Happen (2012) follows the footsteps of the protagonist from the short story 'The Walk' by Robert Walser. Juxtapositions, different speeds and split frame techniques convey the walker's state of mind as he encounters a world of hilarity, despair and ceaseless variety.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8AZvbY86ruHnPBXvBiMlkptxyHF.jpg", "actors": ["John Heffernan (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KMOPMRJiNSQ"}
