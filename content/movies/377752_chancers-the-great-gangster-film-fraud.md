But they are found out, arrested and then bailed. While out on bail, they decide to prove their innocence by actually making a film. They hire a former nightclub bouncer, now a self-made micro-budget gangster film director. In 2011, Paul Knight makes their movie for under \u00a3100,000 with a cast of soap and gangster movie stars including Danny Midwinter, Marc Bannerman and Loose Women's Andrea McLean. The film's title is A Landscape of Lies. But the cinematic alibi does not convince the jury when the trial runs in 2013. The producers are convicted of tax fraud and given long sentences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vz9CYLXejbsSlzRCAhVt7aBIvh2.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Carling (Narrator)", "Paul Knight ()", "Jonathan Sothcott ()", "Freddie Foreman ()", "Danny Young ()", "Mel Mills ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
