No one has a monopoly on truth, and in Tombstone Rashomon, the truth is shared by six conflicting, yet historical perspectives. In doing so, the film\u2019s narrative becomes prismatic and the result is perhaps the most comprehensive telling of the most important gunfight in American history. This is the Tombstone story told in the style of the Japanese classic Rashomon where we see history from several perspectives including that of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Kate, Ike Clanton, Colonel Hafford and Johnny Behan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qVKck3PsKL4bPNWLZZSROB2gZ3P.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Newberry (Wyatt Earp)", "Jesse Lee Pacheco (Johnny Behan)", "Christine Doidge (Kate)", "Eric Schumacher (Doc Holliday)", "Benny Lee Kennedy (Ike Clayton)", "Richard Anderson (Hafford)", "Jason Graham (Virgil Earp)", "Shayn Herndon (Morgan Earp)", "Michele Bauer (Allie Earp)", "Haydn Winston (Frank McLaury)", "Bradford Trojan (Tom McLaury)", "James Miller (Billy Clanton)", "Callie Hutchison (Mattie Earp)", "Rogelio Camarillo (Billy Claiborne)", "Brenda Jean Foley (Mollie Fly)", "Frank Gonzalez (Ned Boyle)", "Wade Everett (William B.
