What happens in the film is a chaos during partying and with the crazy twist and turns, the story head for the conclusion. There's no any difference comparing it with other Christmas party films you had seen. Just the cast and scenario changed, that's all. While the setback for his company branch, the head of the office decides not to compromise on the Christmas celebration thrown to his employees. At the same time, he has to pursue a big client who could save the office from closedown. So his intention turns to impress him at all the cost.\r\n\r\nSeasonal films like this should be watched when it comes out, which is during the Christmas/December. Because it will achieve a better result with us since we're set for the mood. I missed it then, but watched off the season and even though, I quite enjoyed it. Yeah, this film is not any good, yet nothing stopped me from having some fun. The comedies are clich\u00e9, but the actors were good. Fast paced narration, over hundred minutes long. Shot most of the film in a building, there's a little outdoor adventure. Overall, worth a watch, even though a below average film.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [331313, 356305, 213681, 316023], "youtube_key": "g_itBfEC_TI"}
