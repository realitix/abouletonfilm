Increasingly closer images of water, and of light reflected off water, as well as of bursts of fire, intersperse the long shots, the seascapes and all the other interwoven imagery. Eventually a distant volleyball arcs across the sky: this is closely followed by, and interspersed with, silhouettes of a young man and woman in the sea, which leads to some extremely out-of-focus images from a front car window, an opening between soft-focus trees, a clearing. Carved wooden teeth suddenly sweep across the frame. Then the film ends on some soft-focus horizon lines, foregrounded by ocean.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bq3dB3l7SXobVdeaUPDBjXqW9KY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [383841, 285768, 262854, 152973], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
