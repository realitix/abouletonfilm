Bob Hayworth resents Marbury greatly as the latter had married the girl, Lucy Neville, Marbury was courting in pre-war London. Ordered to go on a night patrol, the cowardly Gilroy committed suicide rather than face his fear. Bob and Derek arrange it to appear that Bob had been killed by a shell-burst, and Derek, with his face camouflaged, takes the patrol posing as Gilroy. While on patrol, Derek is hit by a shell-burst and found by the German Red Cross, who turn him over to a family of French peasants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kRWPJpP3ghXEWUfiRdDNpN9P9m.jpg", "actors": ["Ralph Forbes (Derek Marbury)", "Gwenllian Gill (Lucy Neville)", "Monroe Owsley (Bob Hayworth)", "Reginald Sharland (Captain Peabody)", "Douglas Walton (Gilroy Hayworth)", "Alex Courtney (Alan Neville)", "David Holt (Rickey Marbury)", "Billy Bevan (Meadows)", "Clyde Cook (Hawkins)", "Harry Holden (Clerk)", "Charles Coleman (Colonel)", "Colin Campbell (Orderly)", "David Dunbar (Sergeant Matthews)", "Mary Forbes (Lady Heatherly)", "Olaf Hytten (Adjutant)", "Margaret Seddon (Housekeeper)", "C.
