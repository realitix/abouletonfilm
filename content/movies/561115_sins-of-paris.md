Yves Furet, a shiftless gambler, who not only encourages her in her business ventures but is also her fianc\u00e9e, shares the fruit of her non-labor. She latches onto a wealthy widower, Henri Vilbert, who throws her a curve-ball when, after she tells him she is pregnant, he is overjoyed as he has fallen in love with her and is looking forward to becoming a father. She plays along for a while, but becomes ashamed when she sees how Vilbert is devoting his whole life to a child that she isn't carrying. She fakes a miscarriage and his kindness makes her feel guilty and she confesses, but he doesn't believe her. So she tries another plan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kftiGJQD53MtqWesIe1TQa2HcD0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
