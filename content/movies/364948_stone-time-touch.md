The young woman (played by Kamee Abrahamian) is visiting Armenia for the first time. The older woman, Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian has a more conflicted and analytical perspective of her identity and her relationship with the fledgling democracy, one of the former Soviet Union republics. She has been to landlocked Armenia many times and comments on photos taken by French photographer Marc Baguelin. The third trajectory is more subtle and is represented by Garin\u00e9 Torossian herself whose face is super imposed from time to time in this stylistically-layered documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5rL6YKVNBKOGIMI2l2FTo8a8sGJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
