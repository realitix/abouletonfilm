What makes the opera notable within this familiar genre is its emphasis on genuine human emotion. Donizetti\u2019s score is graceful and effervescent, as one would expect from this master of melody, but adds an additional level of sophistication to match the comic (yet insightful) proceedings. Recorded on February 28th 2015, at the Op\u00e9ra de Vichy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Avk8fANhU840xa2OA56FZQcu75.jpg", "actors": ["Simone del Savio (Don Pasquale)", "Anna Sohn (Norina)", "Sergey Romanovsky (Ernesto)", "Alex Martini (Dottore Malatesta)", "Jean Vendassi (Il notario)", "Roberto For\u00e8s Veses (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
