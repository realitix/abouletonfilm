By now, he was under contract for his former rival Path\u00e9, where he made a few of his most lavish productions, including this one. Here, M\u00e9li\u00e8s performed in front of the camera as the Devil [\u2026]. His incarnation of Satan this time is a sprightly antagonist who kidnaps a princess by locking her in a cage and taking off through the sky in a dragon-pulled carriage.
