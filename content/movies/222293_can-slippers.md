We follow Piling, a young soccer fanatic, through a slum district of Manila. No ball or cleats, but a Coke can and flip-flops are the ingredients for a virtuoso demonstration of the football art. Only at the end does it become apparent why the little ball juggler will never be a Ronaldinho.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v7KDcoBTBCO6uecm1pZjMZ7DqxZ.jpg", "actors": ["Jayson Placer (The Player)", "Daryl Reyes (The Goalie)", "Arjay Lanlagura (The Opponent)", "Ryan Lanlagura (The Opponent)", "Gani Agana (The Opponent)", "Flortecante Dayao (The Opponent)", "Jomar Comora (The Opponent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CYT32zhhxvE"}
