Like earlier artists who have treated the Faust legend,he uses it to explore the nature of obsession. But reversing the familiar idea of Faust as an old man yearning to be young, Brakhage makes him a world-weary young man who longs to be old... What makes the film striking is its rich imagery, superbly photographed in dark-hued tones, and its insistent visual rhythms. Brakhage is close to his peak as a bard of the camera and the editing table. \u2013 David Sterritt", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Joel Haertling (Faust)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
