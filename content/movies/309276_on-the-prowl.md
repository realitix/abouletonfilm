The video series is considered to be a watershed entry in the pro-amateur field and is credited as one of the first gonzo videos ever shot.The series is the basis for one of the scenes in the 1997 film Boogie Nights. The basis of the films centered on Gillis approaching random men with the invitation of free sex with a professional pornographic actress or paid escort. Filming locations would range from limousines to adult bookstores and the series was noted for its degradation of the women filmed during the series, who would take part in various elements such as golden showers, analingus, and occasionally physical violence.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
