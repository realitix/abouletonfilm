Built to commemorate their second Championship triumph, The Spion Kop was named after a famous battle in South Africa during the Boer War in which many Lancashire Fusiliers, based in Liverpool, lost their lives. The Kop has become as much a part of the history of Liverpool as Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley and Kenny Dalglish.  100 Greatest Moments Of The Kop looks at Liverpool's outstanding five European Cup wins of the sixties and seventies and their triumphant Champions League run of 2005 which took them through to the Final in Istanbul.  Featuring exclusive interviews with Rafael Benitez, Jamie Carragher, Phil Thompson and Gerry Marsden, 100 Greatest Moments Of The Kop is a spectacular journey of great goals, euphoric celebrations and the legendary songs of the loyal Kopites.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xSw3g4lKhzOW67VAHv8gI7Fo07L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
