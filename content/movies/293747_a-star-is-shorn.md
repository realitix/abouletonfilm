Having just won the hometown title of \"Miss Maple Syrup\", Hazel decides to move to Hollywood to be a star. Speedy cooks up a scheme to get her seen by important Hollywood producer, B.O. Botswaddle (Raymond Brown) who is known to never make a move without Astrological guidance. This scheme involves making up Patsy with turban and a 3rd Eye, and introducing her to Botswaddle as a mystical seer... one, of course, who see's Hazel as the star of his next motion picture. Naturally, things do not go as planned. Treen is especially memorable in a wonderfully goofy role.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qRtTAAisfIovroih6mzYPbgkP6y.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Webb (Speedy Williams)", "Mary Treen (Patsy)", "Ethelreda Leopold (Hazel Hackenschmitt)", "Vernon Dent (Producer)", "Beatrice Blinn (Botswaddle's Secretary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
