Academy Award-winning director Pepe Danquart, fascinated by the spectacle of the three week race, chose to focus on the courage, the pain and the fear of the riders of the Tour.  Training his lens on German superstar sprinter Eric Zabel and his loyal domestique Rolf Aldag, Danquart captures the thrill of the race and the teamwork behind the stars of the peleton. He also shines light on the Tour's supporting cast - the director sportifs, masseurs, and, of course, the wildly enthusiastic fans. Reveling in the stunning landscape - from the Alps to the Pyrenees to the Massif Central to Paris - and with a nice dollop of Le Tour's history, HELL ON WHEELS transcends the sport it celebrates to reveal an astonishing human endeavor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uLf6LyrMWGnQO4rAstmQXe7upPl.jpg", "actors": ["Erik Zabel (Himself)", "Rolf Aldag (Himself)", "Andreas Kl\u00f6den (Himself)", "Alexander Vinokurov (Himself)", "Steve Zampieri (Himself)", "Dieter Ruthenberg (Himself)", "Mario Kummer (Himself)", "Serge Laget (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ly5IkBxvYL0"}
