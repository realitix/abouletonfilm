The Great Blondino follows an anachronistically attired young fellow as he navigates a beguiling, sometimes troubling world with a curiosity that opens us wide to the filmmakers\u2019 inspired, freeform vision. In many ways, the wonder of Blondino may echo the excitement of invention and exploration that Nelson and Wiley experienced in the making of the film. Utterly exuberant and freed from rote cinematic restriction, it embodies an artistic rigor and direction that also prevents it from ever seeming too unhinged. An incredible feat of tightrope walking. \u2014Mark Toscano", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hhy00RPbVpcusGvHyYXMmBGhMyx.jpg", "actors": ["Chuck Wiley (Blondino)", "Lew Welch (Cop)", "Sandra Juste (Trollop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
