However, it is not the stage but a toilet that binds his destiny. He is bewitched by a daring high school girl, Mi-hyun, who comes into the men's room because the women's room is full. From that day on, Min-hyuk woos her, escorts her home at night, stuffs her locker with roses, and clears passages for her in the morning after a snow fall. For all his efforts, he doesn't get much more than a tender glance from Mi-hyun. When she suddenly vanishes \"sorry\" are the only words she leaves behind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wRfaRVKRh8BpvfZU22K5MOR9iEE.jpg", "actors": ["Jeong Han-Yong (Jang Ho)", "Ji Hyun-woo (Kang Min Hyuk)", "Im Jung-eun (Han Mi Hyun)", "Yang Joo-Ho (Yong-Goo)", "Jung Ae-ri (Mi Hyun's mom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [168208, 313628, 26138], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
