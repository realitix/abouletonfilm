Comic legend Zero Mostel stars as an opera singer (in full costume) navigating the London transport network as he attempts to reach Covent Garden in 'Ride of the Valkyrie'.  Scripted by Shelagh Delaney, 'The White Bus' blends realism, drama, and poetry as a despondent young woman travels home to the North of England.  And Vanessa Redgrave stars in Tony Richardson\u2019s romantic reverie and musical featurette 'Red and Blue'. Produced in 1967, but ultimately shelved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aEGNZ1r7kdB43stYnE0SrOvrjqK.jpg", "actors": ["Zero Mostel ()", "Vanessa Redgrave ()", "Julia Foster ()", "Frank Thornton ()", "Patricia Healey ()", "Arthur Lowe ()", "John Sharp ()", "Douglas Fairbanks Jr. ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
