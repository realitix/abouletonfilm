The G1 draws standing room only crowds each night, record receipt gates and generates front-page coverage on the sports sections of several of the daily newspapers in Tokyo. Though it has sometimes been held as a single-elimination tournament, it is usually (and currently) held as a round-robin, with winners from two blocks wrestling in the final to decide that year's winner. The winner of each block is determined by a points system; two points for a victory, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3b414v5onPg2noQm7dfJ6maLBQ1.jpg", "actors": ["Tougi Makabe ()", "Satoshi Kojima ()", "Minoru Suzuki ()", "Shelton Benjamin ()", "Tetsuya Naito ()", "Toru Yano ()", "Hiroshi Tanahashi ()", "Kazuchika Okada ()", "Tomohiro Ishii ()", "Katsuyori Shibata ()", "Fergal Devitt ()", "Yuji Nagata ()", "Chad Allegra ()", "Kota Ibushi ()", "Yujiro Takahashi ()", "Mitsuhide Hirasawa (Captain New Japan)", "Tomoaki Honma ()", "Takayuki Iizuka ()", "Lance Vance Hoyt ()", "Nobuo Yoshihashi (YOSHI-HASHI)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
