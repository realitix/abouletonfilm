It once held great importance as the gateway between east and west in the commercial trading route. Today, it is known more as a tourist site highlighting its ancient glories and natural pleasures, and as an artist colony. Moving onto the mainland, the next stop is Gripshold Castle, named after its builder. Many of the residents of the area don old fashioned colorful garb, they who demonstrate a folk dance of the region. The next stop is the community of Skanstull, located just outside of Stockholm. Skanstull may be the epitome of a modern version of ancient Sweden. Many rural Swedes are descendants of the Vikings, one of the most powerful of the white races ever. The Vikings are responsible for many modern day sporting activities, such as hammer throwing and wrestling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hXkZH46ps9C7cqV8cl6SLVqpmKp.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
