The way of nature is free and in that way does it create life. So is\r it with man as well.  Free will is the expression of the soul. The same will that will not be contained even when\r it is being claimed.  In \u201cForced\u201d we see the fight of the upholding of a will that is not one\u2019s own. The question\r arises for why do we so hardly desire to do that which is in conflict of who we are. That\r same desire which causes the loss of life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kenneth Aidoo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
