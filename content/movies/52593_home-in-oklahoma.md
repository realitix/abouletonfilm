Turner (making him and Lousiania's Jimmie Davis and Texas' W.E. \"Pappy\" O'Daniel possibly the only state governors to write songs used in a western), Flying U ranch owner Sam Talbot is killed by a fall from a horse. St. Louis reporter Connie Edwards comes to check a rumor that he might have been murdered. She goes to Roy Rogers, editor of the local newspaper, and he takes her to the reading of Talbot's will. The ranch is left to Talbot's 12-year-old ward, Duke Lowery, much to the dismay of Talbot's niece, Jan Holloway. After some attempts on Duke's life, Roy finally proves that Jan, Steve McClory and coroner Jim Judnick had Talbot killed and are conspiring to do the same for Duke, making Jan the last heir.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eJ3cL6mtxVMLDzLGNvKfeEiw4nn.jpg", "actors": ["Roy Rogers (Roy Rogers)", "George 'Gabby' Hayes (Gabby Whittaker)", "Dale Evans (Connie Edwards)", "Carol Hughes (Jan Holloway)", "George Meeker (Steve McClory)", "Lanny Rees (Duke Lowery)", "Ruby Dandridge (Devoria Lassiter)", "George Lloyd (Sheriff Barclay)", "Arthur Space (Coroner Jud Judnick)", "Frank Reicher (Jason Cragmyle)", "Trigger (Trigger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
