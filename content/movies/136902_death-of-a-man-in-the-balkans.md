A lonely composer commits suicide in his apartment in Belgrade. Alarmed by the gunshots, Aca and his neighbour Vesko arrive but decide to wait for the police. Soon other characters appear \u2013 an undertaker, paramedics and, eventually, the police, who have been stuck in traffic. The whole film is presented via a webcam set up by the composer before his death, with the characters entering the \u2018set\u2019 through a single entrance. Unaware of the camera catching their unguarded behaviour, the men struggle to remember the composer\u2019s name and admire his d\u00e9cor, wives come and go while the representatives of officialdom exhibit a blind indifference. Inspired by his own experience \u2013 a neighbour was found dead \u2013 director Miroslav Mom\u010dilovi\u0107 has produced a compelling commentary on an absurd reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/GJf0hgEM8MmmtMt2PmV2xBXixr.jpg", "actors": ["Emir Had\u017eihafizbegovi\u0107 (Aca)", "Radoslav Milenkovi\u0107 (Vesko)", "Nata\u0161a Ninkovi\u0107 (Nada)", "Ljubomir Bandovi\u0107 (Policajac 1)", "Bojan \u017dirovi\u0107 (Grobar)", "Anita Man\u010di\u0107 (Vera)", "Milica Mihajlovi\u0107 (Doktorka)", "Branislav Trifunovi\u0107 (Policajac 2)", "Aleksandar \u0110urica (Forenzi\u010dar)", "Nikola \u0110uri\u010dko (Agent za nekretnine)", "Mirjana Karanovi\u0107 (Kupac)", "Nikola Kojo (Kompozitor)", "Bojan Lazarov (Bolni\u010dar)", "Milo\u0161 Samolov (Raznosa\u010d pica)", "Zelda Tinska (Marina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [200487, 10630], "youtube_key": "SNECLOWr9vA"}
