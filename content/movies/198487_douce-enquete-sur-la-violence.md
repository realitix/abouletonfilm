The kidnapping victim rambles on philosophically with his captors, who end up leaving him alone -- thereby providing him with a chance to escape. As he makes a break for it, he is literally hounded by some guard dogs. Then there are also some interviews with people who know one of the kidnappers, though it is not clear why. Neither the victim, nor the kidnappers, nor the filmmakers can compete with the canines, the only protagonists who add some bite to the action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sM0iaA96h8BtHWiJILJz0YbZGxM.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Lonsdale ()", "Elise Caron ()", "Jeanne Herviale ()", "Albert Marcoeur ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
