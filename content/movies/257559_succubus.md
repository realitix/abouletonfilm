Lilith (Liz Vicious), the fabled first wife of Adam, has been awoken from her slumber with a renewed lust for blood. Due to her defiance of God, Lilith was damned to eternal punishment by having to walk the Earth as a succubus demon feeding on the strength and lust of innocent people. Legend tells that only the eldest daughter in the bloodline of Eve herself has the power to stop Lilith. That chosen one is Raven Riley. She is the one who bears the mark and she will not be able to come to peace until she has slain the succubus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mTCh64gQkwjq2ntUFhqvtvLo2Wa.jpg", "actors": ["Raven Riley (Raven Riley)", "Kevin Baxter (Kevin Baxter)", "Thomas Leach (Uncle Joey)", "Kevin Stidham (Kevin Baxtor)", "Liz Vicious (Lilith)", "Matt Danzig (Matt)", "Brandi Love (Candy Carford)", "Mckayla Madison (Gift Shop Girl)", "Mariah Jade (Orgy Participant)", "Amy Sonders (Orgy Participant)", "Bill Rust (Todd the Coffee Boy)", "Isobel Wren (Young Grandmother)", "Michael Love (Fred)", "Jack Sonders (Howie Yoder / Medieval Fire Dancer)", "Ron Jeremy (DJ)", "Tracy Motion (Betty Ames)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ceEa-lRBN40"}
