Since she was a little girl, Clarissa has always wanted to get out of the slums that she lives in. She has always been close to her rich god-mother Monina Gardamonte and to Monina's daughter, Therese. Too close in fact that she confides to her god-mother more than to her own mother, Naty and her elder sister, Nancy. Because of her closeness to her god-mother, Clarissa tasted the high life and has always wanted to be a part of it. When she grew up, she became more determined to be a part of high society, and Clarissa takes every opportunity at all cost to achieve her desires.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Maricel Soriano (Clarissa Rosal)", "Maricel Soriano (Clarissa Rosales)", "Charito Solis (Naty Rosales)", "Ronaldo Valdez (Nick Arnaldo)", "Gina Alajar (Monina Gargamonte)", "Michael De Mesa (Oz)", "Arlene Muhlach (Therese Gargamonte)", "Francis Martinez (Jerome Recto)", "William Martinez (Daryl Revilla)", "Robert Campos (Ralph Gargamonte)", "Ramil Rodriguez (Atty.
