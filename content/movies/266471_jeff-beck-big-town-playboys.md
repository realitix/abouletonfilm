With the Big Town Playboys offering support, Beck rips through 18 Gene Vincent numbers (not \"Be-Bop-a-Lula,\" however), paying tribute to Vincent's guitarist, Cliff Gallup. Beck sounds terrific as he reconstructs Gallup's parts, but he doesn't add anything to the originals. Still, Crazy Legs is a fun listen and offers many insights into Beck's playing, if not Gallup's.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gvW2DcvoGsOVpq0WnndP852E4mq.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Beck (guitar)", "Mike Sanchez (vocals)", "Ian Jennings (bass)", "Adrian Utley (rhythm guitar)", "Clive Deamer (drums)", "Leo Green (tenor & solo)", "Nick Lunt (baritone)", "Mike Sanchez (Piano)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
