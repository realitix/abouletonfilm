Touring for their album Some Girls, a hip and revitalized musical statement that found the then 16-year-old veteran band both revitalized by the sounds of the day \u2013 punk, new wave, disco \u2013 and re-inspired by their old influences \u2013 r&amp;b, blues, country \u2013 the tour would reflect this new inspiration and new energy. The shows were stripped down, straightforward, no-nonsense affairs that picked up on the raw energy of punk that was sweeping through the musical scene, and, I might add, had quite a bit of that late-70\u2032s coked up vibe as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a318ESWnOwHXgkCoxxthJgtBR2L.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Jagger ()", "Keith Richards ()", "Charlie Watts ()", "Ronnie Wood ()", "Bill Wyman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": []}
