It is to my mind a classic example of the funk American Westerns had got themselves into at this juncture of genre film making.\r\n\r\nMichael Rennie and Bill Bixby are badly miscast, Claude Akins overacts to within an inch of his life (a rare poor show from him), while Bernard McEveety's direction shows why he was more at home in TV work. It all looks desperately fake, the interiors of key buildings looking like Wild West themed restaurants, the rest of the exteriors looking like what they are - stages! (most likely built from Chuck Connors' woodenness) Script is weak, which leads to a story that is never once authentic in tone or feeling, scenarios that are meant to be telling are unconvincing and the action is laughably staged.\r\n\r\nNo hidden or misunderstood gem here, just bad film making that irritates as opposed to entertaining. 1/10"}], "recommandations_id": [29116, 249313, 65777, 74753]}
