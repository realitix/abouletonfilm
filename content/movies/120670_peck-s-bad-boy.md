With JACKIE COOGAN, JAMES CORRIGAN. A delightful and very funny comedy about that little imp with the scheming mind Of a devil. Coogans first film after his triumph with Chaplin in THE KID. This very well done portrayal Of small town life before the War is based on a small boys determination to get to see the circus, over all obstacles. Escaped lions, lightheaded blackmail Of his father, and playfully planting stolen papers on his sisters boyfriend are all in a days work for little Henry Peck.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xwOklZmPqhwKXCUj2NWYI1ncrfH.jpg", "actors": ["Jackie Coogan (Henry Peck)", "Wheeler Oakman (Dr. Jack Martin - the Man in the Case)", "Doris May (Letty Peck - Henry's Sister)", "Raymond Hatton (The Village Grocer)", "James Corrigan (George W.
