The film is largely concerned with how context determines the reading of information.  Since the film\u2019s statements oscillate between the deadly serious (concentrating particularly on an examination of the more sinister aspects of humour) and the totally bogus, with no clearly defined points of changeover, the context is often ambiguous. Hopefully, this strategy undermines both the authority of the \u2018serious\u2019 statements and any predictable effect of the \u2018jokes\u2019.
