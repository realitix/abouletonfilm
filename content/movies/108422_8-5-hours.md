A controversial mix of intense drama and some very black comedy, it depicts the personal lives of four workers in a small software company spiralling out of control throughout the course of one working day from 9.00 to 5.30, the 8.5 hours of the title. Sexually charged and constantly surprising, the story relentlessly twists and turns and builds to a series of haunting and unforgettable resolutions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1WVbQYstA0itnWSYOOrrA8Wf5CM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
