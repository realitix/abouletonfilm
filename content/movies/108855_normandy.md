However overall it was a really good story and the lead Tino Struckmann did a great job leading the film. He have a lot of talent and will do well when Hollywood discovers him and he gets his chance in big budget films. \r\nA lot of tanks and WW2 toys in this film, more then even in Saving Private Ryan, I was impressed at a small budget film could do so much on a small budget."}], "recommandations_id": [160019, 297637, 475508, 89591], "youtube_key": "3P6ZKs5EDQY"}
