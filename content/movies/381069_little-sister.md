Young nun Colleen is avoiding all contact from her family, until an email from her mother announces, \u201cYour brother is home.\u201d On returning to her childhood home in Asheville, NC, she finds her old room exactly how she left it: painted black and covered in goth/metal posters. Her parents are happy enough to see her, but unease and awkwardness abounds. Her brother is living as a recluse in the guesthouse since returning home from the Iraq war. During Colleen\u2019s visit, tensions rise and fall with a little help from Halloween, pot cupcakes, and GWAR. Little Sister is a sad comedy about family \u2013 a schmaltz-free, pathos-drenched, feel good movie for the little goth girl inside us all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aRjYNKsUG10HeLEiSU4TO3tI6hU.jpg", "actors": ["Addison Timlin (Colleen Lunsford)", "Ally Sheedy (Joani Lunsford)", "Keith Poulson (Jacob Lunsford)", "Peter Hedges (Bill Lunsford)", "Kristin Slaysman (Tricia)", "Molly Plunk (Emily)", "Barbara Crampton (The Reverend Mother)", "Taylor Jones (Young Colleen)", "Kyle Prado (Young Jacob)", "Alston Brown (Chip)", "Tony Greenberg (David)", "Brian McCarthy (Bernie)", "Joan Shangold (Sister Abigail)", "Sandra Vaughn-Cooke (Sister Isadora)", "Reid Meadows (Kid)", "Sunita Mani (Performance Art Dancers)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46226, 291871, 324276, 333358], "youtube_key": "o6QUuw1Kpik"}
