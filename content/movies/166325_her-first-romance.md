Her selfish stepsister and guardian, Eileen, refuses to buy Linda a dress and decides that she is too young to attend. Katy, the cook, buys Linda a dress and with the help of Linda's cousin, Marian, conspires to get Linda to the dance. When Linda's friend Suzy tells her that she was invited as a prank, however, she refuses to go to the dance. Without her glasses and wearing stylish clothes, Linda is quite attractive, but she still rejects all the invitations from the fraternity brothers. She is crying outside the house when Chicago opera star Philip Niles arrives and offers to escort her to the dance. Eileen is at the dance with her fianc\u00e9 John Gilman, who was Marian's boyfriend until Eileen stole him away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x1CepC7c4oBtsOekzoTdDqMVIJk.jpg", "actors": ["Edith Fellows (Linda Strong)", "Wilbur Evans (Philip Niles)", "Julie Bishop (Eileen Strong (as Jacqueline Wells))", "Alan Ladd (John Gilman)", "Judith Linden (Marian Strong)", "Roger Daniel (Donald Whiting)", "Marian Kerby (Katy (as Marion Kirby))", "Marlo Dwyer (Susie Sloan (as Marla Dwyer))", "Ottola Nesmith (Mrs. Whiting)", "Ray Hirsch (Student Butch)", "Alexandria Moreland (Co-Ed Gladys Jones)", "Edwin Brian (Student)", "Julie Sheldon (Co-Ed Nancy)", "John Adamson (Student Friday)", "Ann Doran (Student (uncredited))", "David Durand (Student (uncredited))", "Eddie Hall (Student Mushface (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
