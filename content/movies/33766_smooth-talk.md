In a deeply unsettling and slightly surreal scene, a hunky stranger (Treat Williams) comes calling for her, and she realizes that she's not as mature as she thinks. The film captures the same other-worldly quality of the short story (the scene with Treat Williams plays out almost like a feverish dream), while ably adapting it to the very different needs of a feature length film.\r\nDern gives a wonderful performance, one of many given by this underrated actress."}], "recommandations_id": [26195, 38349, 55916, 68876], "youtube_key": "k6B_BEmo7ws"}
