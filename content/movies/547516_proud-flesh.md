Through her encounters with a parched landscape and beings both physical and metaphysical (including a virtual labyrinth of mounds, geisha dancers and her pious lace-maker double, Alma), Proud Flesh is no mere re-visioning of the American Western. It is a meditation on the iconography and gestures contained within the genre itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1OpntdWg50PTTAHS60jkX0UJXAk.jpg", "actors": ["Inge-Lise Sheppard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
