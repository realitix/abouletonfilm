Travel to colorful Colorado to see the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and watch as the 2-8-2 #473 charges up Animas Canyon in the dead of winter. Visit Heber Valley Railroad and 2-8-0 #618 as it moves through the winter paradise of Utah's Wasatch Mountains. Enjoy winter action with the Nevada Northern as 4-6-0 #40 and 2-8-0 #93 pull passenger and freight trains, sometimes using both engines at once! Finally, discover what a pusher locomotive is all about as 7-3-4 shoves a freight train through the mountains of Western Maryland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dCzprMQsFIblTLbQOTXgPUHoJnC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
