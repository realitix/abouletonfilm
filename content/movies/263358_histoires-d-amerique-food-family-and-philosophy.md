The anecdotal nature of the subject matter compels Akerman to fragment her narrative, rather than offer it in one, uninterrupted continuum. Still, another Akerman trademark -- permitting the \"drama\" to emanate from the actors rather than the situations -- is very much in evidence. This informal history of Jewish life over the past 100 years is related in a series of eyewitness accounts, re-created by a group of largely unknown actors. Also known as American Stories, the Belgian/French Histoires d'Am\u00e9rique began building an audience when it was shown at the Berlin Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/roE2p1eT8woepp9rh7OgWD0pwZ1.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Amitin ()", "Eszter Balint ()", "Stephan Balint ()", "Judith Malina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
