They must face Davis, an iron-fisted and murderous supervisor; there's at least one turncoat, willing to inform on their fellow workers; and, there are passions on all sides, including one between Fernando, a leader of the miners, and Virginia, the godchild of the mine's owners. Can the miners win a victory, and at what cost? Baldomero Lillo, a grocery clerk, records it all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/91o7n68VsbOcPA2KX00mhBXefme.jpg", "actors": ["Francisco Reyes ()", "Paulina G\u00e1lvez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
