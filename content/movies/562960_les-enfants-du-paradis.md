In a staging reminiscent of a movie set, the mime Baptiste bathes in his memories, tell about his encounter with Garance, his impossible love for a marvelous yet unattainable woman, the magical universe of the stage, life behind the scenes, and the tenuous line performers maintain between reality and illusion. Marc-Oliver Dupin's original score provides the musical backdrop for a choreography alternating between larger ensemble numbers and intimate love duets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJByOCai7IcSZqIiBQQg4wXaNHF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
