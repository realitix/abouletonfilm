It is made purely from the US side and takes place mostly in the US military command and control bunkers. The movie tries to be serious, however it is overly optimistic about the USAF chances to win the nuclear war.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
