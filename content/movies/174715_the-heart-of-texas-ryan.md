Mix is a cowpuncher on the Ryan ranch who falls for old man Ryan's pretty daughter (Bessie Eyton), recently returned from the East. At first thought of as something of a fool, Mix proves his worth by capturing a member of a notorious gang of rustlers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lCMEHO1HGwFP8BsUXburk0AUHFQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
