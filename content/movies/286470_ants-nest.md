Led by Virginia, the younger nuns stand up for changing the strict religious dogmas and would like a modern school with genuine science, a bathroom to be built, and a freer spirit. Their candidate is sister Magdolna, who went to secular universities, too. The seminarists, led by Kir\u00e1ly Erzsi, also rebel against the older nuns' strict discipline and the depressed atmosphere of the institution. However, Magdolna does not want to stay involved in the fight because she is deterred by Virginia's sinful attraction towards her and the tools Virginia is using to gain victory at any price.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8fj96t4z0Yf1Am5ZE80cDJgtyjH.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c9va Vass (Magdolna)", "Pap \u00c9va (Gregoria)", "T\u00f6r\u0151csik Mari (Virginia)", "Jaroslava Schallerov\u00e1 (Gruber Hel\u00e9nke (as Jaroslava Schallerova))", "Margit Makay (Leona)", "Magda Kohut (Bernarda)", "No\u00e9mi Apor (Simonia)", "M\u00e1rta F\u00f3nay (Kunigunda)", "Gy\u00f6rgyi Andai (Kir\u00e1ly Erzsi)", "Ildik\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (Pavel (as Szab\u00f3 Gabriella))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
