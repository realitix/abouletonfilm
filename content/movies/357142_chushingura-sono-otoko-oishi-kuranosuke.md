Lord Asano was ordered to commit ritual suicide and the Ako clan abolished. Facing up to the gravity of this unfair ruling, since only one party was being punished instead of both as would be usual, Oishi decides to lead the loyal former retainers in an attack on Lord Kira so that he could take Kira\u2019s head to his lord\u2019s gravesite so that Lord Asano could finally rest in peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n5spsBJWL67y2WBZp273iuEoROi.jpg", "actors": ["Masakazu Tamura (Kuranosuke \u014cishi)", "Shima Iwashita (Riku \u014cishi)", "Tetsuji Tamayama (Naganori Asano)", "Rei Dan (\u963f\u4e45\u91cc\uff08\u7464\u6cc9\u9662\uff09)", "Yukiyoshi Ozawa (\u5800\u90e8\u5b89\u5175\u885b)", "Toshiyuki Nishida (Yoshinaka Kira)", "Masat\u014d Ibu (\u67f3\u6ca2\u5409\u4fdd)", "Kinya Kitaoji (\u7acb\u82b1\u5de6\u8fd1)", "Yuriko Ishida (\u6d6e\u6a4b\u592a\u592b)", "Isao Hashizume (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
