Lust for sex? Self-preservation? Childhood trauma? Father quest? Who can really see? A Police Officer who wants to bring Rosie back onto the right track does - but Rosie is too busy flirting with middle-aged men, destroying virtuous families and scheming her way up the social ladder, while also wallowing in seedy night clubs of the \u201960ies wrestling Frida, the naked dancer hiding a rod, for Jim\u2019s eyes only. Jim is not 100% sure which one of the two blondes he wants to kill so he might just make a serious mistake and kill Rosie. But is it really easy for a nymphet to be killed?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jazMZ3oZzMO9f5Obwv8sxcY26Ze.jpg", "actors": ["Mirka Kalatzopoulou (Rozy Kareni)", "Zeta Apostolou (Frinta)", "Dimitris Myrat (Kostas Zanitos)", "Pavlos Liaros (Jim)", "Stavros Xenidis (Luke)", "Andreas Filippides (Karelas)", "Soula Athanasiadou (Loula)", "Koula Agagiotou (Kaiti Zanitou)", "Giorgos Grigoriou (prosecutor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
