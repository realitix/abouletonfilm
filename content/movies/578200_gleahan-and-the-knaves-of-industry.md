Together, they go on a quest to defeat the \"Dark Lord\" who apparently rules Duluth. But as Mark delves deeper into Gleahan's fantasy, it becomes clear just how real -- and insane -- Gleahan's plight truly is.  Together, Mark and Gleahan dodge faceless goons and escape a mustache-twirling business executive. They ransack a \"dragon's hoard\" full of drugs and guns. They team up with a surprisingly knowledgeable bartender and face down a \"dark princess\" who wants to overthrow her father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4rzf98MoT4PAo71ANB8dfLKblfJ.jpg", "actors": ["Kent Dean (Mark Sanders)", "Don Millikan (Gleahan of Eastvale)", "Ramona Marozas (Madison)", "Henriette Soderlind (Penelope Johnson)", "David Aldridge (Nathaniel Johnson)", "Ian Vincent (Derek Olson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KbF0WsgJmAM"}
