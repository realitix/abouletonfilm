And when it happens, you are so damned tired, that you couldn't care less,' says Robert Cooper, an EU peace negotiator whose job it is to get Serbia and Kosovo to reach an agreement about peaceful coexistence. National pride and compromise are on everyone's lips, and much is at stake: Kosovo wants to come closer to independence, the Serbs have been promised EU membership if they can reach an agreement, and the EU tries to strengthen its credibility. But how far is each party willing to go? It is the unique characters that make this fascinating film about a delicate political game so vivid and loveable. The stoic, Serbian negotiator has a great passion for rock music, his colleague from Kosovo does not want to miss out on his daily visit to the hairdresser, and Cooper himself has a closet full of ties - one for every conceivable occasion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lbPgfe4iGIT8LM8AoWSSweWGVGe.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Cooper (Himself)", "Edita Tahiri (Herself)", "Borko Stefanovic (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
