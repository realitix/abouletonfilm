A ghost / spirit starts stalking Mohini and takes voyeuristic pleasure in watching her nude while dressing up etc. Meanwhile, their neighbors have a small kid, Vicky, who claims to be able to speak to his dead grandfather. Vicky seems to see the spirits of departed souls but no one believes him. He claims that the spirit of Captain Raju is in the house of the newlyweds. Harsha and Mohini make plans to go for a honeymoon to Paris. But things take an ugly turn once the ghost decides to start getting aggressive in its overtures towards Mohini. The shell shocked young lady attempts to flee from the evil spirit, but all her attempts are blocked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/34tN7xAUU0DopwbZhvlQvK2FtZQ.jpg", "actors": ["Shamna Kasim (Mohini)", "Harshvardhan Rane (Harsha)", "Ravi Babu (Captain Raju)", "Jeeva (C.I.
