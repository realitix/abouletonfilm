We follow Eric\u2019s day-to-day life and become immersed in the solitude he is trying to overcome. Through his feelings and memories of better times we get to see what it\u2019s like for the thousands of old people who live every day without any human contact. Ending with a message that love can beat despair, Ladder to You can also hopefully inspire people to give a little more time to the older folk who live amongst us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/YR5SFQaHNzpJJFK12a3PEa8vkj.jpg", "actors": ["Clive Russell (Eric)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
