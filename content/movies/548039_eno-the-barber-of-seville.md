Despite a disastrous opening night \u2013 the music teacher tripped over and had a prolonged nosebleed and an unexpected cat wandered on stage \u2013 it has gone on to be \u2018perhaps the greatest of all comic operas\u2019. Indeed, Rossini himself stayed at home for the second night, until he was awoken by the sound of applause and cheering and his opera has delighted audiences ever since.  Based on a play called Le Barbier de S\u00e9ville by French playwright Pierre Beaumarchais, this is the first of three plays about a character called Figaro. His second play, Le Mariage de Figaro, was the inspiration for another opera \u2013 The Marriage of Figaro by Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Rossini\u2019s The Barber of Seville, therefore, is considered a prequel to the story of Mozart\u2019s opera, although it was composed 30 years later.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6l8U3SCHZev2rLqI274RXZQSVfr.jpg", "actors": ["Katherine Broderick ()", "Matthew Durkan ()", "Barnaby Rea ()", "Andrew Shore ()", "Eleazar Rodriguez ()", "Kathryn Rudge ()", "Morgan Pearse ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
