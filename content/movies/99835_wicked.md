Jan can't resist the huge bulge in Brent's jeans and the two quickly get at it and ravage each other's hard bodies. \"Cut. Great, you guys\" yells Doug Jeffries. It turns out that Jan and Brent are finishing up a scene in his new movie and they did an awesome job. Just then, Brandon Lee bursts into the room and sees them finishing up the scene. \"What the fuck is that? That was my scene!\" Brandon screams at Doug. \"Brandon, you won't bottom and Brent is only a top, so I had to get Jan to fill in\" Doug tells him. \"I don't need you or this stupid movie\" says Brandon as he storms off the set. Doug and stagehand Rod Barry discuss the old days when Brandon used to be so sweet. \"Boy, times have changed\" says Rod.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dKDaTyLIs2yAoc2NNWoiWoMnXOn.jpg", "actors": ["Brandon Lee ()", "Brent Everett ()", "Eddie Stone ()", "Jan Fischer ()", "Jason Hawke ()", "Joey Milano ()", "Johnny Hazzard ()", "Luca DiCorso ()", "Shane Rollins ()", "Tag Adams ()", "Tommy Ritter ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
