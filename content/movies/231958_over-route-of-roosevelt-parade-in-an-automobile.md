The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 1. An automobile ride down San Francisco's busy Market Street, showing the elaborate decorations, crowds of people, traffic, etc. A very novel and effective picture.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
