Hank, Sebastian's step-father, drops a bomb: he announces he's changing sexes. Sebastian's sister splits immediately for California, and his mother takes him back to England. Jump ahead eight months, Sebastian is back in New York, knocking on Hank's door. Hank (now Henrietta, although all the surgeries aren't complete) takes Sebastian in and is his rock over the next few months of high school. Sebastian's \"adventures\" are mostly self-destructive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8ZXDdF8Z8HgPNvcehjdXkguSvD5.jpg", "actors": ["Adrian Grenier (Sebastian Cole)", "Clark Gregg (Hank / Henrietta)", "Aleksa Palladino (Mary)", "Margaret Colin (Joan Cole)", "John Shea (Hartley Cole)", "Marni Lustig (Jessica Cole)", "Tennison Hightower (Anne)", "Gabriel Macht (Troy)", "Famke Janssen (Fiona)", "Nicole Ari Parker (Nurse Jenny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PU95IFnj4RA"}
