The same can be said for this 1986 film version, likewise a homegrown Australian product. Set in the 1930s, the film stars Helen Buhay as a starry-eyed young girl chafing under the oppressive attitudes of society in general and her father in particular. She kicks over the traces to enter into a romance with college Latin professor Hugo Weaving. Still not realizing that Weaving considers her a pleasant diversion and nothing more, Helen nearly misses out on a chance for happiness with liberal-minded banker Sam Neill. Once she's settled down with Neill, the idealistic Buhay is smitten by another aesthete, poet Huw Williams. Neill encourages this affair, hoping that Buhay will eventually realize that there's more to true love than mere sexual impulsiveness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fiqXPIdLTUyj4W2phKhrBHJVPBv.jpg", "actors": ["Helen Buday (Teresa)", "Sam Neill (James Quick)", "Hugo Weaving (Jonathan Crow)", "Huw Williams (Harry)", "Hugh Keays-Byrne (Andrew)", "Odile Le Clezio (Kitty)", "John Polson (Leo)", "Nicholas Opolski (Lance)", "Judi Farr (Aunt Bea)", "Anna Lise Phillips (Ann)", "Tracey Higginson (Malfi)", "Regina Gaigalas (Jean)", "Naomi Watts (Leo's Girlfriend)", "Jennifer Hagan (Manette)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
