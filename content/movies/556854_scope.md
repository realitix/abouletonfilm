The sound is a long whistling. The original film is an orientalist peplum called The New Adventures of Ali Baba, typical of the cinemascope genre movies with many extras, wide shots and muscle-bound male torsos. The film's image slowly shrinks until it becomes a narrow band and disappears completely.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
