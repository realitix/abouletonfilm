His wife, Lucy, has locked him in to a daily routine. His work in a small commercial shop and grocer's has worn him out. His dreams have evaporated into the drought of the beaten earth of Mindelo. Now forgotten, with his past as a great football player for Mindelense, in St Vincent in Cape Verde, he only has the belated compassion of his friends, neighbours, and cafe companions: \"He was important\", \"He was the keeper in Cape Verde\", \"He could have played for Benfica!\" Mane rejects the loss of his status as a hero. When training a youth team he sees himself again in KALU, a rebellious but talented youth. He is guided by a whirlwind of thoughts; he was also young, had opportunities, felt the sting of love and wasted his flame. A beaten leather ball shines in his hands once again, Benfica, his club, calls him to the Portuguese Cup Final.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wPCARohCB6XjAJYMNsFdJ6XPxYi.jpg", "actors": ["Carlos Germano (Mane)", "Benita Lopes (Lucy)", "Paulo Miranda (Kalu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
