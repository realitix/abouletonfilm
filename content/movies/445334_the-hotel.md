The first two were The Atlantic (Atlanten, 1995) and The Lighthouse (Fyren, 2000). The hotel is a different kind of home. It can be a refuge, cul-de-sac, castle, nightmare, creative space...The first hotel was created as protection against the elements. Weary travellers could find shelter and rest. But it was also a place for legends and anecdotes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hcm1d36SKeUpOBEfolVom1Polqj.jpg", "actors": ["Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd ()", "Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen ()", "\u00c5sne Seierstad ()", "Lars Nor\u00e9n ()", "Paul Herman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
