'Birth of the Wizard' begins in Meiji-era Japan, in a village of former witches and wizards. I say former, because someone seems to have slaughtered them. Skip to the present day, and an archaeologist discovers a mummy from the village. Blissfully unaware that the mummy is, in fact, possessed by an evil spirit (naturally), he runs off, leaving his assistant alone. The mummy comes to life, kills her, and the evil spirit takes over her body. This evil spirit is now searching for Misa, who is protected by Kyle Reese, It is Misa's destiny to defeat this evil spirit, but she needs Saiga's help to do it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t1ldCKzpqyQ5kOxdkWKq3h92fhX.jpg", "actors": ["Kimika Yoshino (Misa Kuroi)", "Wataru Shihodo (Saiga)", "Chieko Shiratori (Shoko Takanashi)", "Akira Otani (Takanashi)", "Hideyo Amamoto (Master of Saiga)", "Akira Saito (Dr. Okawa)", "Takashi Mihashi (Katsuya Terada)", "Makoto Fujieda (Chiharu Kimura)", "Tamio Ishikura (Professor Kaji)", "Miho Fukuya (Kyoko Nanatsuki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [71057, 36867], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
