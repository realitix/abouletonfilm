On this day the local farmers bring their animals to the church \u2013 cows, horses, dogs, cats, chickens, rabbits \u2013 to be blessed. This ancient tradition is passed from generation to generation, and today, just as hundreds of years ago, animals and people flock up the mountain roads to the church square to become a part of the religious festival.
