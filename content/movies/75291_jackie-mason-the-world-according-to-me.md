This show earned Mr. Mason a special Tony award for outstanding theatrical achievement in 1989 as well as his first Outer Critics Circle Award, ACE Award, Emmy Award, and Grammy nomination. Once in a generation a performer emerges who is so extraordinary and so brilliant that everyone else in the field is measured against them. Jackie Mason is such a performer, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest stand-up comics of all time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/myQxmhZQ4dud0JEHz0MPnyaKS7K.jpg", "actors": ["Jackie Mason (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
