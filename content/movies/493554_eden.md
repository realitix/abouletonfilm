I drive a taxi. Every day is meaningless to me and my few other hobbies are flying kites and squeezing my brain for words to write a novel with.  I've been having bloody nightmares for some time and one time I picked up a strange woman. She says she's a half-witted revolutionist but won't say who she really is. I give her a name: Hye-mi, and start my relationship with her in the ruptured life of mine.  I find a new meaning to life and I try to enjoy her stories, love and pain she carries. For her.  However, she disappears on me without a linger and a year after that, I get a postcard from Hye-mi without a return address. I had forgotten about her, but I began pulling out memories of her once again.  Was there an Eden for these two people who didn't know they were related? Where was their Eden?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ofGa4sF6Rcab21NT2fuuamaODn4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
