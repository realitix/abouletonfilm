When not cooking up scams with his buddies, Kobayashi develops a crush on Fuji\u2019s disgusted sister, Masako Izumi. But soon the young hoods run afoul of their underworld idols when they rob the wrong gang, led by brutal boss Jotaro Togami. The saga begins with a bumptious comic tone but descends into appropriately grim territory once blood has been shed and mischievous youthful illusions are shattered. When Kobayashi\u2019s pals start to bite the dust, he hooks up with a more traditional yakuza (Ryoji Hayama) to retaliate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z7bnCf5ZFhPUXw66pnQ5bAjJ4WW.jpg", "actors": ["Tsuneo Aoki (Murai)", "Tatsuya Fuji (Taro)", "Jotaro Togami ()", "Akira Kobayashi (Yuji)", "Ry\u00f4ji Hayama (Goro)", "Masahiko Tanimura (Matsuyoshi)", "Yuri Yoshioka (Reiko)", "Rika Fujie (Rosa Natsukawa)", "Hiroko Machida (Mariko)", "J\u00f4 Shishido (Imano's Bodyguard)", "Eiji G\u00f4 ()", "Nijiko Kiyokawa ()", "Isao Tamagawa ()", "Keiko Hara ()", "Masako Izumi ()", "Takamaru Sasaki ()", "Takehiko Maeda ()", "Hiroshi Tachikawa ()", "Ichir\u00f4 Mishima ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
