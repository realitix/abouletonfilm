The opera is set in an afterlife existence of the Versailles court of Louis XVI. In order to cheer up the ghost of Marie Antoinette, who is upset about having been beheaded, the ghost of the playwright Beaumarchais stages an opera (obviously based on La M\u00e8re coupable, although described by Beaumarchais as a new composition) using the characters and situations from his first two Figaro plays.  In this new opera-within-an-opera, Count Almaviva is in Paris as ambassador from Spain. Together with his trusty manservant Figaro, he tries to rescue Marie Antoinette from the French Revolution. When things go awry, Beaumarchais himself enters the opera and \u2013 with the invaluable help of Figaro and his wife Susanna \u2013 attempts to rescue the queen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vtNtRwEiY5zNISaLXEChu9z79dG.jpg", "actors": ["Teresa Stratas ()", "Marilyn Horne ()", "Ren\u00e9e Fleming ()", "Gino Quilico ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
