For one she never suffered physical abuse before the attempted murder and she does not come from modest or marginal family. As she says: 'There is no profile for battered women and it can touch anyone.' She also is a strong woman and a fighter who is not afraid to criticize the ineffectiveness of institutions. For me as a man was also very important to approach the male and try to find out what happens inside a violent man and what leads him to violence. In this sense i found the work of the therapist Harald Burgauner, who is one of the most prestigious specialists in Austria, of particular interest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g74yVeRmGU0djF9CDqdFg2DKGge.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dVheeYjJtF0"}
