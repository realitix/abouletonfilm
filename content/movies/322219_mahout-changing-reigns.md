For centuries they have relied on their symbiotic relationships with elephants for survival and social devlopment. As their landscape changes ecologically and economically, so too does Gwi culture. \"Mahout: Changing Reigns\" explores this cultural evolution and the Gwi's legendary link to elephants through the last living docents of a bygone era.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
