Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city's streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.  The first installment of the series begins with the founding of New Amsterdam, a Dutch trading post. The city starts to take shape as New Amsterdam becomes British New York. By the Revolutionary War, the city becomes the site for several key battles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDajh1wK6vGSi26dWEJl25GanLp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
