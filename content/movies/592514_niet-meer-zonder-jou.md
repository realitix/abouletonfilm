In stylized recordings, the women show extreme frankness. The viewer witnesses what the integration process looks like within this Turkish family, making it clear what the process of dialogue, misunderstanding and alienation yields within the intimacy of immigrant families. The understandable pain of this family about the modern life of their daughter gets an accessible face.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y7BEMl2RFP6XO1LpsowoxsPZT4g.jpg", "actors": ["Nazmiye Oral ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
