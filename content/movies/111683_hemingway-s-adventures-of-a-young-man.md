He is touched and affected by his encounters with a punch-drunk ex-boxer, a sympathetic telegrapher, and an alcoholic advanceman for a burlesque show. After failing to get a job as reporter in New York, he enlists in the Italian army during World War I as an ambulance driver. His camaraderie with fellow soldiers and a romance with a nurse he meets after being wounded propel him to manhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7k2wM3DwrCkL96S4W52V1PGbzPD.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Beymer (Nick Adams)", "Diane Baker (Carolyn)", "Corinne Calvet (Contessa)", "Fred Clark (Mr. Turner)", "Dan Dailey (Billy Campbell)", "James Dunn (Telegrapher)", "Juano Hern\u00e1ndez (Bugs)", "Arthur Kennedy (Dr. Adams)", "Ricardo Montalban (Major Padula)", "Paul Newman (The Battler)", "Susan Strasberg (Rosanna)", "Jessica Tandy (Mrs. Adams)", "Eli Wallach (John)", "Sharon Tate (Burlesque Queen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
