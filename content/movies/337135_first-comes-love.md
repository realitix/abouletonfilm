{"tmdb_id": 337135, "title": "First Comes Love", "original_title": "First Comes Love", "slug_title": "first-comes-love", "date": "1991-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "First Comes Love consists of perfectly choreographed scenes of four wedding ceremonies accompanied by a complex medley of popular love songs. All seems to be going as it should until the couples reach the altar, when the celebratory atmosphere is interrupted for a surprising public service announcement. Then song and dance continues until the happy couples depart, leaving behind a dwindling crowd and a few altar boys who carefully sweep up the rice that blankets the pavement like snow. The film doesn't attempt to defend--or discredit--the institution of marriage. Instead, it reveals the many subtle emotions surrounding the event, and raises questions about how the double standard regarding marriage affects gay and straight couples.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kJFwSNOEnPq8pHBNudZLlzu2pes.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
