A longtime devotee of the world of dance, Bass felt compelled to give this young boy the opportunity to leave his home and follow a dream that he could not yet have fully imagined. From the serene countryside of Southeast Asia to the halls of New York\u2019s School of American Ballet to the stage of the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, DANCING ACROSS BORDERS peeks behind the scenes into the world of dance and chronicles the intimate and triumphant story of a boy who was discovered, and who only much later discovered all that he had in himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ueTRHuyU8tmE50Avt2xIHdQzWcC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
