Due to his injuries, Do-sub ends up staying in Lee's barn. When Do-sub and Hyang-ah fall in love, Lee kills Do-sub and throws his body in the mountain. However, it turns out that Do-sub isn't quite dead so Hyang-ah runs away with him and looks for the performance group. To save his family's honor, Lee kills Hyang-ah's servant Yu-wol and holds a funeral for her, pretending that it is Hyang-ah. Now part of the performance group, Hyang-ah gives birth to a son and learns the traditional Korean masque dance from Old Man Song. When Hyang-ah learns of her father's death, she goes to his grave where her older brother, Byung-jun, grabs her and locks her up.
