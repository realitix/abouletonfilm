They plan to skip town with the entry fees, but a menacing thug from the \"Citizens for Fair Play\" convinces them otherwise. The contestants: A singing hippo, \"Mother Goose\" who starts out as an old woman, then sheds her disguise to reveal a pretty girl, and a fan-dancing ostrich. Throughout, a couple of penguins are heckling. The ostrich proves wildly popular, and Screwloose fears he'll have to give the prize to her, when he gets an idea. He dresses J.R. up as the ostrich and sends him out, but the penguins use a box of sausages to expose the dog. The crowd runs Screwloose and J.R. out, and they grab a ride on a train where the penguins are waiting for them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t0mKywbol23SBN7EMh0H6OFFklW.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Count Screwloose (voice))", "Dave Weber (Tough Guy (voice) (uncredited))", "Georgia Stark (Contestant (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
