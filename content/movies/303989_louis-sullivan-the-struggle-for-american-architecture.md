Known by historians as the 'father of the skyscraper' and creator of the iconic phrase 'form follows function,' Sullivan was on top of his profession in 1890. Then a series of setbacks plunged him into destitute obscurity from which he never recovered. Yet his persistent belief in the power of his ideas created some of America's most beautiful buildings ever created, and inspired Sullivan's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Frank Lloyd Wright, to fulfill his own dream of a truly American style of architecture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wZR9KMF5PDZQbA9eCiMgdKG442L.jpg", "actors": ["Madolyn Smith Osborne (Voice of Louis Sullivan)", "Mark Richard Smith (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
