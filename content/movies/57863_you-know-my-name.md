Boom times have come to the oil-rich town. So has a new breed of criminal. You Know My Name is the fact-based story of Bill Tilghman, a lawman and former partner of Wyatt Earp confronted by an emerging era when outlaws run whiskey instead of cattle and are likely to tote a tommy gun as carry a six-gun. An ideally cast Sam Elliott plays Tilghman, whose life takes on a newfangled wrinkle of its own. Tilghman makes a moving picture of his Old West exploits; and the success of that silent film, The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws, spreads his reputation like a brushfire. But that reputation may mean nothing to a thug (Arliss Howard) who hides behind a badge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5y3NsHMD94nl3VRYPVKcCmTQlza.jpg", "actors": ["Sam Elliott (Bill Tilghman)", "Arliss Howard (Wiley)", "Carolyn McCormick (Zoe)", "James Gammon (Real Arkansas Tom)", "R.
