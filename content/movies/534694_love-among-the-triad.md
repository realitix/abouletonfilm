The film centers around Ching Kit, a mob boss who instead of using typical tools of underworld shakedowns -- mob hits, blackmail, and the like -- employs the dinner party to negotiate deals, to forge partnerships, and craft revenge. When Ching works out a deal with the Portuguese mob that would give him partial control of Macau's casinos, he quickly learns that treachery lurks around every corner. Veronica Yip Yuk-hing, Cecila Yip Tung, and Pauline Wong Siu-fung also appear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dimiLA1HNJWJvBSF76mlddV8Vko.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Yam (Ching Kit)", "Cecilia Yip (Cecilia Lee)", "Veronica Yip (Sue)", "Vincent Wan Yeung-Ming (Tong Chun)", "Rosamund Kwan (Kwok Hoi Lam)", "Pauline Wong Siu-Fung (Ma Man Fung)", "James Pax (Pak Shek)", "Jamie Luk Kim-Ming ()", "Sherman Wong ()", "Alexander Chan Mong-Wah ()", "Teddy Chan (Cecilia's brother)", "Lam Wai ()", "Jackie Lui Chung-Yin (Brother Yin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
