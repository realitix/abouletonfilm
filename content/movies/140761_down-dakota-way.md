T. McKenzie (Roy Barcroft). To avoid an expensive quarantine on his stock, McKenzie plans to murder the local veterinarian (Emmet Vogan) before the latter can report his findings to the government. Rogers manages to straighten out the situation by appealing to the sensibilities of the aunt (Elizabeth Risdon) of McKenzie's hotheaded hired assassin (Byron Barr). The film also bears several musical numbers from Roy, Dale Evans, and Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6BjpxEVSxqeRHcEi1ueS7BNEzsm.jpg", "actors": ["Roy Rogers (Roy Rogers)", "Trigger (Trigger)", "Dale Evans (Ruth Shaw)", "Pat Brady (Sparrow Biffle)", "Montie Montana (Sheriff Holbrook)", "Elisabeth Risdon (Dolly Paxton)", "Byron Barr (Steve Paxton)", "James Cardwell (Saunders (McKenzie's Foreman))", "Roy Barcroft (Mack McKenzie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
