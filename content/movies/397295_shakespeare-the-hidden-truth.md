Several of books on codes, ciphers and cryptology were published throughout the 16th and 17th century. Petter Amundsen relies partly on steganographic techniques described in known publications from this period when deciphering hidden messages. He also follows instructions found in Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio and on the memorial tablet in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon.  Two books have been particularly important in Amundsen\u2019s research: Francis Bacon\u2019s \u201cThe Advancement of Learning\u201d and Gustavus Selenus \u201cCRYPTOMENYTICES ET CRYPTOGRAPHIAE. Libri IX\u201d.  In \u201cThe Advancement of Learning\u201d has a description of a bi-literal cipher, which Petter has made an attempt using on William Shakespeare\u2019s original gravestone. The English edition was published in 1640, several years after Francis Bacon\u2019s death. Bacon wrote that he had invented this code-system in his youth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lCSf8F8vvcNmEbkrWXZ6LXYNt5D.jpg", "actors": ["Petter Amundsen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
