To prevent him losing face, Kruse brings together four people - a dramaturg, a composer, a writer and an architect - and gives them the thankless task of turning his idea into a film. Except for the relatively unknown composer Alexander Ritter, who is enthusiastically committed to the project, the other members of the team find themselves stuck in this mess.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cZaXlud08bQc3efzIegDI4jveVJ.jpg", "actors": ["Christel Bodenstein (Claudia Gl\u00fcck)", "Manfred Krug (Alexander Ritter)", "Gerry Wolff (Jens Holle)", "Johannes Arpe (Produktionsleiter Otto Kruse)", "Jochen Thomas (Hans Kn\u00fcller)", "Agnes Kraus (St\u00f6rungsstelle)", "Werner Lierck ()", "Claus Schulz ()", "Hans Klering ()", "Willi Schwabe ()", "Nico Turoff ()", "Pedro Hebenstreit ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
