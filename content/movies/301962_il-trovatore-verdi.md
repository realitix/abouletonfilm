But when she is about to carry out this fatal act, the gypsy sacrifices her own child and keeps the old Count\u2019s son, whom she names Manrico (IL TROVATORE, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo). Later, as adults, the troubadour Manrico and the Count di Luna\u2019s elder son (Piero Cappucilli) do not know each other, but become rivals for the beautiful Leonora (Raina Kabaivanska). Manrico succeeds in winning the young woman\u2019s heart, and she sacrifices herself for him, deceiving the Count\u2019s son. Mad with jealousy, the latter orders the execution of the troubadour in front of his mother. Azucena reveals to him that Manrico was his brother.  This legendary performance of Giuseppe Verdi's most successful opera was recorded at the Vienna State Opera under the baton of Herbert von Karajan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oVA4DKu48hWR74b45Dlj0iikgB9.jpg", "actors": ["Piero Cappuccilli (Conte di Luna)", "Raina Kabaivanska (Leonore)", "Fiorenza Cossotto (Azucena)", "Jos\u00e9 van Dam (Ferrando)", "Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Manrico)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
