His stamping ground is modest, the strip of suburbia between his mom\u2019s house in New Jersey and the pizza place where he works. Mike\u2019s no great conversationalist and isn\u2019t big on direction either, preferring to let things happen than making them happen himself. Feeding a neighbour\u2019s dog, bumping into a friend, catching a hockey game: all just different reasons to trudge along the same wintry streets, unhurried, ungainly, alone.  One day, opportunity knocks. Mike bumps into his old school friend Mark, who asks Mike to take over his walking tour job and Philadelphia apartment during his trip to Poland. A change of season, a change of scene, a change of fortune? The streets Mike now wanders through are different and the sun is shining, but otherwise it\u2019s the same old story: new people and new encounters, laced with the usual awkwardness and inertia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbnmDdnCsdctNmi5zA3E4qZfyMC.jpg", "actors": ["Mike MacCherone (Mike)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
