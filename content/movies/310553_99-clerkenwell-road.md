Ceiling lamps become coloured spheres and circles that sweep across the frame. Pillars provide wipes and fades, window shutters are hole punched stencils, passing buses shoot beams of light.

Scale and depth constantly shift and colours are blindly combined as exposures gradually multiply", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gfm9pkOrHGou403d5Nd0RaRvW7Y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
