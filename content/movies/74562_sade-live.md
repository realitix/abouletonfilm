As fine as the voice is, we can never forget that Sade's backing band are sidemen rather than mere accompanists, and in several of the 18 numbers here we get solos of real virtuosity. The selection of songs includes many of Sade's hits--\"Cherry Pie,\" \"Smooth Operator,\" \"Your Love Is King\"--and some less well-known songs from the albums, such as \"Red Eye\" and \"Jezebel.\" --Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a8PQXOxz2BWGEin3Z0QFkM0qxm5.jpg", "actors": ["Sade ()", "Andrew Hale ()", "Stuart Matthewman ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "TulsaTV", "content": "This document of the 1993 Love Deluxe World Tour was taken from two concerts in San Diego.\r\n\r\nThe cohesive band often creates a hypnotic feel. Their emphasis is on creatively supporting the songs, rather than mood-breaking displays of virtuosity.\r\n\r\nThe entire setlist for the tour is presented. Sade herself provides a fetching visual focal point."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
