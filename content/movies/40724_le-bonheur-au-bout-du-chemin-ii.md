She makes the acquaintance of a handsome, rich, bachelor, chases a cow, and wins (to her chagrin) a baking soda company's writing contest. She acts as Diana's maid of honor, and refuses Gilbert Blythe's marriage proposal; which sends her to teach Kingsport Ladies' College, an exclusive girls school, where she meets opposition from one of the teachers, Miss Brooke, and the Pringle clan (one of whom is a rich, handsome bachelor). But while Anne enjoys the battle, and the friends she makes, she returns to Avonlea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vCanTIB3gCmJcJPyy7KjgOYThx6.jpg", "actors": ["Megan Follows (Anne Shirley)", "Colleen Dewhurst (Marilla Cuthbert)", "Patricia Hamilton (Rachel Lynde)", "Jonathan Crombie (Gilbert Blythe)", "Wendy Hiller (Mrs Margaret Harris)", "Frank Converse (Morgan Harris)", "Rosemary Dunsmore (Katherine Brooke)", "Marilyn Lightstone (Miss Muriel Stacey)", "Genevieve Appleton (Emmeline Harris)", "Susannah Hoffmann (Jen Pringle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [17663, 103886, 402272, 138311], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
