The comic\u2019s hero is Kaktus Kid \u2013 a small cactus trapped in his pot. Intrigued, Zograf investigates into the life of Kaktus Kid\u2019s creator \u2013 little known artist Veljko Kockar. He soon discovers that Kockar was arrested just after the liberation of Belgrade in 1944. He was charged for being a Gestapo agent and executed. Zograf\u2019s investigation reveals a far more complex story: Kockar\u2019s identity and artistic works were stolen, he possibly has an affair with the girlfriend of a guerilla soldier and he drew anti-communist propaganda for the Nazis. As he explores the story and pieces together the scraps of evidence 70 years after it happened Zograf is faced with his own personal and artistic dilemmas: why do these little drawings have such power to give consolation but also lead to violence?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/N8Uh35NioAtFA7FdUsnCvrfQwM.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksandar Zograf (Himself)", "Milutin Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (Veljko Kockar)", "Jovan \u0106irilov (Himself)", "Zdravko Zupan (Himself)", "Robert Crumb (Himself)", "Tihomir Stani\u0107 (The guy from OZNA)", "Viktor Savi\u0107 (The Snitch)", "Ana Mandi\u0107 (Veljko's Lover)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2KvKza6PGKE"}
