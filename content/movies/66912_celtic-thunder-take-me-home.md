The DVD with a running time of almost 2 hours long features 13 new Celtic Thunder performances! After the smash success of the first Celtic Thunder production in 2008, producers Sharon Browne and Phil Coulter have developed an all-new Irish-music showcase. The sharply dressed male vocalists who starred in the first show have returned, and each performer gets a chance to show off his pop sensibility. The energetic set includes traditional Celtic tunes as well as rock covers and original compositions by Coulter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3CTSCSIeC16CFOxBtWwWKBLzgzu.jpg", "actors": ["Damian McGinty (Himself)", "Keith Harkin (Himself)", "George Donaldson  (Himself)", "Paul Byrom  (Himself)", "Ryan Kelly   (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
