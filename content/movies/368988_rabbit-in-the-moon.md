Fifty years later acclaimed filmmaker Emiko Omori asks her older sister and other detainees to reflect on the personal and political consequences of internment. From the exuberant recollections of a typical teenager, to the simmering rage of citizens forced to sign loyalty oaths, Omori renders a poetic and illuminating picture of a deeply troubling chapter in American history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rKufsf9qMzl21UyN07zqR0IE6YI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
