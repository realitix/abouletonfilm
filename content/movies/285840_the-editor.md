What a complete delight this film was.  Hilarious, weird, and totally camp in all the right ways.\r\n\r\nThis film is a spoof/homage to the classic 70s Italian slasher genre Giallo.  It completely nails the genre in every aspect.  The ridiculous over the top acting, bad over-dubbing, often nonsensical plots, bad gore effects with bright red blood, casual misogyny, bizarre dialogue, homo-eroticism.  This film has it all.  If you aren't familiar with the genre this will come across as a weird poorly made grindhouse film, but if you are well versed in Italian slashers you will appreciate all the leather trench coats, gloved hands and shiny bladed knives.  A must see for fans of Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and Sergio Martino"}], "recommandations_id": [138792, 206721, 231082, 73201], "youtube_key": "_YbDv5HxjnI"}
