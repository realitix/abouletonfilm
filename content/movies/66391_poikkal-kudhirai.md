Balachander and produced by Kalaivani. Starring Viji and Raveendran, the film had Ramakrishna and lyricist Vaali making their acting debuts. Kamal Haasan appeared in a guest role. Poikkal Kudhirai was based on Crazy Mohan's play Marriage Made in Saloon. Poikkal Kuthirai is an hilarious depiction of how Sambandam (Vaali) \u2014 who bets on each and every small thing and wins \u2014 and Indu (Ramakrishnan) enter into a bet at a saloon owned by Muthu (Ravindar). The bet is that Indu will win Sambadam's daughter Janaki's (Viji) heart and marry her. If Muthu is successful in his mission, Sambandam will shave half of his moustache for their marriage. If he fails, Muthu will shave his head. Who wins the bet is the film's narrative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ENLB3jKVciCfyf4b5J1CQqKGEp.jpg", "actors": ["Rama Krishna (Indhu)", "Kamal Haasan (himself acted inside photo frame (guest appearance))", "Viji Thamby ()", "Radha Ravi (Nair)", "Charle (Paramasivam)", "Viji (Janaki)", "Kavignar Vaali (Sambandham)", "Raveendran (Muthu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3CS7h15Sb1s"}
