Trotzig's language is strongly driven and honored, often dark and hard-to-reach, but with a sharpness penetrating deeply into the reader susceptible to her prose. The main themes of her books are guilt and liberation, often with a Christian vocabulary, and the balance between ethics and ethics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yp5iDreyIjNUtx3zGW9GYgIwY5K.jpg", "actors": ["Birgitta Trotzig ()", "Agneta Pleijel ()", "Jan Bergquist (reader)", "Bo Bjelfvenstam (reader)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
