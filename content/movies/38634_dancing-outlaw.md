Ray White. We meet Jesco's three distinct personalities; the gentle and loving Jesse, the violent and dangerous Jesco, and the extremely strange Elvis. We also encounter various members of Jesco's family, all nearly as eccentric as Jesco himself. You will ask, \"Are these people for real?\" Yes, they are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7vVMx5XkfDO5ydTgiHuYku7Hb7V.jpg", "actors": ["Jesco White (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
