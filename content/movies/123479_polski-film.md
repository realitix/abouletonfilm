Their ambitious colleague Jan Buda\u0159 takes up directing duties and financing has arrived from Poland. What started out pleasantly enough, however, soon goes awry. Li\u0161ka\u2019s pronunciation difficulties, Daniel\u2019s alter ego Havl\u00e1t, and Matonoha\u2019s financial machinations turn the shoot into a fight for survival. More than just a film about friendship and the absurdity of actors\u2019 lives, director Marek Najbrt gives us a witty meditation on reality and illusion, and a unique take on the reality film genre. One of Pavel Li\u0161ka\u2019s on-set comments (\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I should act as if I were acting, or act as if I weren\u2019t acting, or just not act at all\u201d) illustrates the provocative nature of Najbrt\u2019s subversive, quasi-documentary game.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/on0SBHsU6jb5QCrFV3MCfNT181j.jpg", "actors": ["Tom\u00e1\u0161 Matonoha ()", "Jan Buda\u0159 ()", "Josef Pol\u00e1\u0161ek ()", "Pavel Li\u0161ka ()", "Marek Daniel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YVDCewh3o2c"}
