Dany and Martine come to investigate and hear first Therese's story about how Luc, Paul and Jacques coerced her into indecent acts, such as pharmacist Luc talking her into giving him a blow-job as a means to relieve her migraine. Dany and Martine soon conjecture that this is all wishful thinking and that Therese merely wants to get hitched and get laid. So they validate the hypothesis by trying out the men for themselves. In the end, Therese is happy too, because our heroines arrange a hot date with Jacques - with a predictable outcome.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Richard Allan ()", "Karine Gambier ()", "Dani\u00e8le Troeger (Dany)", "Martine Grimaud (Martine)", "Siegried Cellier (Claudine)", "Rachel Mhas (Therese)", "Guy Royer ()", "Madou Sall ()", "Ghislain Van Hove ()", "Jean-Louis Vattier ()", "Laurence Thibault (girl by swimming pool)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
