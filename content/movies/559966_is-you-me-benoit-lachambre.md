A pictorial decor in constant motion, the piece shows two dancers arranged like musical notes on a score. Half way between a dance and a montage, the show plunges the audience into a world at the crossroads of animation and graphic performance.  Choreography by Benoit Lachambre, with Louise Lecavalier. This crossover, in the form of a game of mirrors, brings together two brilliant artists: the first breaks the codes, the second alternates between volcanic and fragile behaviour. A show that opens up many questions:  \u201cAm I me or you? Are you me? Do you see me as I see you?\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rojGOLt9fbpXDgBbBbGShZkvtuu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
