In a series of tableaux, people perform everyday tasks \u2014 sleeping, dining, reading, card-playing \u2014 as the camera arcs past and over them (the replete set of positions recalls La r\u00e9gion centrale\u2019s movements). Brown abraded the film stock, creating a continuous dynamic surface-effect tension with the comparatively static views and cueing the soundtrack, the crackle of fire. The physics and chemistry of combustion were the scientific focus of Lavoisier, the 18th-century savant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mXid6GOJAA8B0YtLq66YfpAQeWi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
