Paramount apparently never got round to including the filmmakers in any newsreel, but their own film survived in the Bute-Nemeth Archive. (weirdwildrealm.com)  To the rhythm of music that sounds a bit like a Busby Berkeley tune, lines and circles appear against a black background. Then triangles, in groups. Black and white squares move in tandem. Sparkling forms turn in kaleidoscopic patterns. Then cubes appear, white against the background, bouncing; a yin and yang rotate a few times before the film ends with an quick burst of scattering light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h0wfNlUlam3Q4K6uUwoOwjg35Tt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
