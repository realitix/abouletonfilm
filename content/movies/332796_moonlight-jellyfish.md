In order to support his younger brother, Seiji is forced to join the local Yakuza and work through the ranks to become a respected member. One night, Seiji saves a woman named Keiko (Aya Okamoto) from a drunken pervert. By sheer coincidence, she is also Michio\u2019s nurse and falls in love with Seiji thanks to his courageous act. Whilst Seiji continues to see his new girlfriend, the activities of the Yakuza begin to affect their lives\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fyQ0X8vKAFp3u4c1kNOQQ1Ukywu.jpg", "actors": ["Tatsuya Fujiwara (Seiji Terasawa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
