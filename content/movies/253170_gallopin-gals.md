We drop in on the fillies, who gossip in New York accents. That's followed by a pre-race fashion parade. In both of these, Maggie doesn't join in; she runs every year, but suffers from hay fever. The actual race is run, and Maggie is far back in the field. The other horses hear it's going to be a photo finish, though, and they all come to an abrupt stop and pose except Maggie, who keeps running and wins the race.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QExZE0kklpmqkMla6oexO8BDEh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
