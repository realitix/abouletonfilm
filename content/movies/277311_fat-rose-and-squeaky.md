When Bonnie's long-lost niece, Christine, attempts to trick her out of her house, the two friends come up with a plan. Using Bonnie's association with the wacko neighbors (Fat Rose &amp; Squeaky) as examples of her inability to safely care for herself, Christine's plan appears to be working. The friendship between Bonnie and Celine proves to be a greater challenge to Christine than her aunt's age.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Louise Fletcher (Bonnie)", "Cicely Tyson (Celine)", "Julie Brown (Squeaky)", "Lea DeLaria (Fat Rose)", "Jo Anderson (Christine)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
