The story is told by a narrator with a lovely British voice that reminded me of Malcolm McDowell and he does all the voices of all the characters as well. The story is about an ageless old crocodile that is quite nasty--even for a croc! Because he's older and lazy, he mostly just sits around doing very little.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tYT5HCjKSYojqlGEmnQbY3h9daT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
