It\u2019s a great opportunity to see Marlon Brando relaxed and fully playing up the self-parody angle. Plot finds Matthew Broderick as Clark Kellog, a film student arriving in New York who through unfortunate circumstances ends up working for a man who is not too dissimilar from Don Corleone!\r\n\r\nWriter and director Andrew Bergman spoofs the Mafia via screwball scenarios and satirical scripting, though the latter is done to death and grows tiresome at the mid-point. Penelope Anne Miller and B.D. Wong get choice support roles and deliver the goods, in fact the casting across the board is spot on, and the tech credits are firmly in the plus column.\r\nIt\u2019s all pleasantly executed and moves along at a brisk pace, but a little less satire and more straight laced character comedy wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [2107, 16384, 10631, 2321], "youtube_key": "c_pEcCnzYzI"}
