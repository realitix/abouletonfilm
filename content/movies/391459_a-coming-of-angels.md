Spectators therefore got a chance to behold the female detectives doing the things they had fantasized about.  There is some bondage in this film, but it is somewhat soft. Jamie Gillis stars as the pervert who kidnaps girls and sells them into white slavery, and John Leslie is really fun as one of Jamie's minions.  The cast is handsome and the sex is spicy. Lesllie Bovee is at her top in this movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e2tHRO5Q0QNfQ4l11G6ePrqT2hm.jpg", "actors": ["Lesllie Bovee (Robin)", "Abigail Clayton (Jennifer)", "Annette Haven (Carrie)", "Jamie Gillis (Mark)", "Amber Hunt (Sherry)", "Susan McBain (Andrea)", "John Leslie (Robert)", "Eric Edwards (Andy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
