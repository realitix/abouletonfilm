Only the statue\u2019s monumental head was completed, and we see it from all angles, close up and further away, in Nys\u2019 grainy super 8-film. Beyond the subject\u2019s surly, infinite gaze, life in the town\u2019s main square takes its daily course \u2014 one that no longer corresponds with the utopian vision of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iGcjlOlJSdSSQo02vx77uiuP0KG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
