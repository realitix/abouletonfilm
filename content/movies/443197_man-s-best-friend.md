They settle into the hunter's cabin and each go to their respective beds (with the hunter promising more hunting bright and early the next morning much to the hound's disgust). At any rate, the dog settles into bed but is kept awake all night by all manner of distractions. First, he deals with a noisy cricket which he settles and then is disturbed by the moonlight outside reflecting off a clock's pendulum. After that, the rug catches fire and the heroic dog bravely saves the house from being burned to a crisp by dousing it with water. But now his bed is all wet so he settles in with his master... who snores to the point of annoyance. Finally, morning comes and the hunter is raring to go but the insomniac dog tells the old boy off and goes to live with the other animals!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pinto Colvig (Hunter (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
