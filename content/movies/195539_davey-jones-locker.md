From the side, we see a two-masted ship. Across the deck walks a skeleton. It sits down, its legs akimbo. The legs separate and continue a dance while the body of the skeleton faces us and the skull moves its jaw bone. It rises and the legs rejoin the skull and body for an additional jig back and forth on deck.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wPJ3iVXF7fbazb17FbdUHzKcCUw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [72696, 144489, 125673], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
