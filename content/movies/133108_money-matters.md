Her relationship with her mother Pamela Matters (Aunjanue Ellis- RAY, MEN OF HONER), is far from stable and depicts the struggle between a young mother and daughter who both come of age...together. Sharp and candid dialogue blur the roles of parent and child, revealing a family secret magnified by pain and years of regret. Money's daily routine; a three-bus commute to the Catholic school she attends, far from her dilapidated neighborhood, to another world where she feels just as uncomfortable. When she befriends a neighborhood girl who seems to understand her, their friendship develops in ways that push boundaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h1zol1IjrxHuNePhx7WqIb0fR5T.jpg", "actors": ["Terri Abney (Monique 'Money' Matters)", "Aunjanue Ellis (Pamela Matters)", "James Whalen (Bobby Lewis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
