First of a 3-film series, Congo: A Political Tragedy is a feature-length documentary chronicling the political history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the arrival of the first European settlers to the nation\u2019s struggle for independence.  It offers the unique perspective of Congolese co-writers Patrick Kabeya and Mina Malu, as they document the history of a country that has so far mostly been told through the eyes of foreigners.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gFuFwFku6tUOs4BHixAIVRqzfXL.jpg", "actors": ["Patrick Kabeya (Director)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "65yEMU52V_U"}
