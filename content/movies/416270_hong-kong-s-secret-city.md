Christa Wesemann, an Austrian documentary filmmaker, has achieved this for the first time. The recordings from the \"walled city\" are breathtaking pictures, as it has never seen the world. The history and daily flow in Walled City are ruled by the \" triad\" (Chinese Mafia).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qdDZ1llovyV0kT0Mus0U6GkKLyr.jpg", "actors": ["Otto Clemens (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
