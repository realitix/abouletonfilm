He is a hard-working man, trying to make the most of what he has. One day, his childhood friend Gildo reappears, driving a fancy car and boasting of his successful life in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, S\u00e3o Paulo. As the two sit down for a beer, memories, regrets and old resentments slowly resurface... but at the root of all the tension is a painful childhood secret that needs be told. With cinematography by the inimitable Walter Carvalho (Central Station), Whirlpool has a rich visual style that gives an extraordinary depth of feeling to the story of this industrial town and its inhabitants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/biYEzgd6bvnavkuZEVgeRElEZG1.jpg", "actors": ["Irandhir Santos (Luzimar)", "Dira Paes (Toninha)", "J\u00falio Andrade (Gildo)", "C\u00e1ssia Kis Magro (Marta)", "Demick Lopes (Zunga)", "Cyria Coentro (H\u00e9lia)", "Camila Amado (Bibica)", "In\u00eas Peixoto (Suzi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
