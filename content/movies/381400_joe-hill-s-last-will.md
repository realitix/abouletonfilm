Legendary labor songwriter, Joe Hill, is in his cell at the Utah State Prison, hours away from his execution for a trumped-up murder charge.  A reporter has been sent from a local paper to record his last words.  Maybe Hill will give them to him, maybe he won't.  But first, the reporter will have to hear the story of Hill's life, the history and thinking behind his songs, the philosophy of the industrial Workers of the World for whom Hill writes, his thinking on life and labor, love and death, And he'll have to hear many songs.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["John McCutcheon (Joe Hill)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
