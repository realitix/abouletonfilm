One of his best known short films was 1978\u2019s The Magic Flute set to the music from Mozart\u2019s two-act opera.  As a stage director, Luzzati had mounted a lavish 1963 full-scale production of the opera and fell in love with the music and the story. His animated The Magic Flute, made fifteen years later, was met with glowing reviews and multiple awards. He followed the completion of the film with a children\u2019s picture book that succinctly retells the story.
