Lasky production HERE'S TO ROMANCE. His career bankrolled by the beneficent opera diva Mme. Schumann-Heink (playing herself), singer Nino Donelli (Martini) hits the big time, and as a bonus falls in love with his leading lady Lydia Lubov (Anita Louise). For a while, however, their romance is nearly loused up by wealthy, self-centered art patrons Kathleen and Emery Gerard (Genevieve Tobin and Reginald Denny). Also complicating matters is amorous ballerina Rosa (Maria Gambarelli), but she leaves the scene after turning down both Nino and Emery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j420wEohuWG2751LVJqBZpY9DJo.jpg", "actors": ["Nino Martini (Nino Donelli)", "Genevieve Tobin (Kathleen Gerard)", "Anita Louise (Lydia Lubov)", "Maria Gambarelli (Rosa)", "Mme.
