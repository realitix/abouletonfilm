For music of such complexity and intensity, the brevity of this opera is just right; you could take it as five hours of Verdi or Wagner concentrated and crystalized in one hour of Schoenberg.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4GU3HVZafwf6HfrxwUIf0iXigVo.jpg", "actors": ["Michelangelo D'Adamo ()", "Brigitte Geller ()", "Eliahu Inbal ()", "Georg Nigl ()", "Sonia Visentin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
