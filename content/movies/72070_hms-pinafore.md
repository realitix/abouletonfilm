{"tmdb_id": 72070, "title": "HMS Pinafore", "original_title": "HMS Pinafore", "slug_title": "hms-pinafore", "date": "1997-05-01", "genre": ["Musique"], "score": "8.5/10", "synopsis": "This nautical story of star-crossed lovers kicks off when the Captain of the H.M.S. PINAFORE makes arrangements for his daughter to marry the Lord Admiral of the Navy. However, problems ensue when his daughter reveals she\u2019s in love with a low-ranking seaman aboard her father\u2019s ship. Ironically, the Captain finds himself in a similar position with a dockside vendor called Little Buttercup. The whole situation is turned on its head when Little Buttercup reveals a game-changing secret she has kept for decades...  This is no ordinary production of G&S. It fairly zings along, bubbling with joie de vivre, good humour and spice. However, you won't like this version of Pinafore if you're a strict G&S traditionalist. Considerable liberties are taken with the script; two songs are left out and several songs adapted from other G&S operas are added; Act II has been radically changed - and the music is played on three Moog synthesizers, with never a violin in sight!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvj7zulaRJJhqsXEeih0vuccrOg.jpg", "actors": ["Jon English (Dick Deadeye)", "Simon Gallaher (Ralph Rackstraw)", "Amanda Muggleton (Little Buttercup)", "Helen Donaldson (Josephine Corcoran)", "Drew Forsythe (The Rt.
