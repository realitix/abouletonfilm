Baron Munchhausen. His crazy, yet very merriment, stories, views and behavior is what sets him apart from others. He becomes alienated from the society that failed to grasp his brilliance. In fact, his brilliance is what underlines the faults with the society itself. It's a beautiful yet tragic story that is filled with dense and intellectual dialogue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wl53j6QvnBdOXVMHrEl0oJC7Y4o.jpg", "actors": ["Oleg Yankovskiy (Baron Munchhausen)", "Yelena Koreneva (\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430)", "Leonid Bronevoy (Hertzog)", "Aleksandr Abdulov (Ramkopf)", "Leonid Yarmolnik (Theophil Munchhausen)", "Inna Churikova (Jakobina Munchhausen)", "Yuri Katin-Yartsev (Thomas)", "Semyon Farada (Commander-in-Chief)", "Vladimir Dolinskiy (Pastor)", "Igor Kvasha (Burgomister)", "Vsevolod Larionov (Judge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [27940, 27935, 273202, 27942], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
