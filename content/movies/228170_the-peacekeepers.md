Focusing on the UN mission, the film cuts back and forth between the UN headquarters in New York and events on the ground in the DRC. We are with the peacekeepers in the \"Crisis Room\" as they balance the risk of loss of life on the ground with the enormous sums of money required from uncertain donor countries. We are with UN troops as the northeast Congo erupts and the future of the DRC, if not all of central Africa, hangs in the balance. In the background, but often impinging on peacekeeping decisions, are the painful memory of Rwanda, the worsening crisis in Iraq, global terrorism, and American hegemony in world affairs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A1KLZIJ5Q1xBnKprChHhcMgWCIo.jpg", "actors": ["Karen Feiertag (Narrator)", "Kofi Annan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
