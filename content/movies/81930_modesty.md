The characters in this story are a man who is going to die, a woman who receives anonymous erotic notes, an older man who is offered a last chance at falling in love, a teenager struggling to handle the doubts generated by puberty and a small boy who sees ghosts. As is the case in many families, in spite of living together, all the characters in Pudor are alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8s9xZcps6wT9TY1AoL149nrlc79.jpg", "actors": ["Nancho Novo (Alfredo)", "Elvira M\u00ednguez (Julia)", "Natalia Rodr\u00edguez (Marisa)", "Celso Bugallo (abuelo)", "Carolina Rom\u00e1n (Gloria)", "Marcos Ruiz (Sergio)", "Manolo Solo (Hombre X)", "Nuria Gonz\u00e1lez (Pilar)", "Joaqu\u00edn Climent (Juan Luis)", "H\u00e9ctor Colom\u00e9 (Sr. Braun)", "Lorena Mateo (Carolina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
