Since the dawn of Rock and Roll, there has been ministers howling about its evil affects. Ministers would tour the country's churches and college campuses with sermons and slide shows illustrating the Devil's influence on the rock music. In this film we certainly see that rock stars aren't the best role models for kids and teens, but the Peters brothers often miss the musician's point \u2013 especially with some of the lyrics. Dan and Steve do however seem to take a delight in presenting some of the 1980s more perverse album covers to young people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o7N5ecftqTRL9SHJcxBYFwzh07d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
