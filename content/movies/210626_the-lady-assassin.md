But rather than sell themselves, the girls rob and murder their guests, hording a growing pile of gold for a rainy day.  In their latest haul, however, the women discover the bound and desperate Linh Lan (Tang Thanh Ha) hidden in a coffin. She begs them to spare her life and train her in martial arts, so she can kill evil general Quan Du, who murdered her family. Kieu Thi agrees, and takes Linh Lan under her wing, but it soon transpires not everyone is who they originally claimed to be.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f3XXe04CqKAV6vixFASquYefwet.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Dzung (Li\u1ec5u Th\u1ecb)", "Thanh H\u1eb1ng (Ki\u1ec1u Th\u1ecb)", "Thai-Hoa Le (T\u01b0\u1edbng qu\u00e2n Quan Du)", "Di\u1ec5m My 9x (Mai Th\u1ecb)", "Ngoc Quyen (\u0110\u00e0o Th\u1ecb)", "T\u0103ng Thanh H\u00e0 (Linh Lan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [116149, 131634], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
