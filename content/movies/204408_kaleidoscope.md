The material turns out to be too incohesive and abundant to work into a pointed, thematic article, and just when he is about to give up, his younger brother asks him a simple question: \"How many coal burners are there in Calcutta?\" This triggers an idea for a story about Calcutta's pollution -- and the aspiring journalist dreams of myriads of burner-toting citizens invading the publisher's home demanding redress. Maybe he is finally on the way to a story that matters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hOQlmBFVctnjvlbevL6b89dqt8B.jpg", "actors": ["Anjan Dutt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
