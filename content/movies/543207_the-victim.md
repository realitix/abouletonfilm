His captors introduce themselves as a duo of deranged sadists who have targeted him at random as their next victim and that he is to be tortured and eventually killed.  Their captive is surprisingly calm considering his predicament and soon reveals himself to be a fugitive on the run for similar crimes. He even offers to join forces with his captors and demostrate his own methods of pain infliction on a fresh victim.  A battle of loyalties ensues between the three men as the victim plays on his captors differences. Is he the psychopath he claims to be or does he have another agenda?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ldx0pFcG8gRggoH1Eqj8a4BWIbO.jpg", "actors": ["Matthew Benson ()", "Jack Gallagher ()", "Marc Bolton ()", "Jackie Knowles ()", "Lucy hoult ()", "Luke Gardiner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
