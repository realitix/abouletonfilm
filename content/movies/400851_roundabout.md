The money leads us to each of the five offbeat characters, all in desperate need of their soul's redemption: a disillusioned tabloid reporter planning to commit suicide in a motel, a nightclub dancer con prostitute who has avowed to give her kid sister a better life, a fallen henchman resurfacing to score big time, a chronic runaway teenage girl held captive as sex slave by a cop, and a long-suffering son bearing a sadomasochistic relationship with his brutish, half-paralyzed father who behaves like a mad dictator in his wheelchair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xumT896N2ZpYLDx8j7HmnhiFbFU.jpg", "actors": ["Shamaine Buencamino ()", "Celso Ad.
