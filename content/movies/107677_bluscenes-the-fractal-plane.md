Even in our digital age, our computers are incapable of rendering these complex animations in real-time. This program was almost a year in the making, resulting in an experience that is simultaneously technological, nostalgic, beautiful and sublime. It's colorful and evolving art with the power to transform a room completely. BluScenes: The Fractal Plane includes two Ursitti compositions, \u201cThe Fractal Plane\u201d and the \u201cMathematical Daydreams,\u201d both with original 7.1 scores composed and performed by Chris Martyn and Geoff Harvey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q1MM6Lbp8ZN3XmONVQymCdsHxkq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
