Inspired by architectural renderings and the idea of virtual tour, the video invites the viewer to visit its structure through specific parameters. Throughout the visit, \"entities\" arise and disappear regularly as if haunting this virtual environment. Visites Possibles also acts as a transitory space where multiple doors open on potential virtual experiences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l5lfDpjtiLNkZnSVDlpu4KxMahm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
