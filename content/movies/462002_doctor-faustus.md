Having decided he has accumulated all he can of conventional knowledge, Doctor Faustus turns to magic in a quest for greater truths. Before long, he ends up selling his soul to the devil \u2013 the famous \u201cFaustian pact\u201d that has entered everyday language. Dr Faustus gradually realizes his terrible mistake. He apparently repents, but finally dies, the devil coming to collect his soul, and his friends the dismembered body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6pbiDmuRoWfAatym1GhLXVLgrFf.jpg", "actors": ["Joanna Christie (Evil Angel/Helen of Troy)", "Beatrice Curnew (Chorus/Wrath)", "Amy Rockson (Devil/Pride/Duchess of Vanholt)", "Amy Rockson (Vintner/Envy/Paramour)", "Harvey Virdi (Vintner/Envy/Paramour)", "Jonathan Battersby (Good Angel/Old Man)", "Guy Burgess (Wagner/Lucifer/Beelzebub)", "Samuel Collings (Valdes/Rafe/Devil/Covetousness)", "Mark Extance (Lawman/Gluttony/Cardinal/Emperor)", "Gareth Kennerley (Faustus)", "Adam Redmore (Cornelius/Robin/Lechery)", "Tim Treloar (Mephistopheles)", "Conrad Westmaas (Priest/Devil/Sloth/Pope/Alexander/Duke of Vanholt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
