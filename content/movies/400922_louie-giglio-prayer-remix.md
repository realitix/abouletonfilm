Yet, while these prayers are part of the Biblical journey, the fact that they dominate our conversations with God can indict a me-centered faith that is distant from the New Testament adventure we are called to in Christ.  ReMIXED prayers embrace these four concepts, while moving towards a healthier, God-centered prayer language that saturates our thoughts and words with the phrases, \"Let Me Bless You,\"\"Live Through Me,\" and \"No Matter What, Use Me.\"  A subtle shift based on radical truth.  Potent prayers for a full life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ldBdmEVr9L8IXNNsK1VDMzT73XH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
