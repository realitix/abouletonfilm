Four young men and two young women are on a drive. There's a rivalry between two guys for one of the girls. On a remote road, the car stalls. The driver hitchhikes for help. Led by the intrepid girl, the others walk toward abandoned buildings, perhaps a mining operation. One of the three guys sits and reads. The intrepid one explores the building and sees something that scares her. She screams; the two rivals and the second girl run to find her. Something she says starts a fight between her two suitors. The one reading a book walks away in disgust. After stopping the fight, the two young women follow. How can this end?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQ5yEutFDloouRQZAtAUg14uQIs.jpg", "actors": ["Lawrence Jordan ()", "Yvonne Fair ()", "Taggart Deike ()", "Walter Newcomb ()", "Eva Neumann ()", "Robert Benson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
