France has passed a law banning religious symbols in public schools. Mariam, born in France to Arab parents, recently began to wear the hijab after performing the hajj with her grandmother. At the start of the academic year, she pretends the new law does not exist, as she does not want to acknowledge it and so be forced to make a decision. To complicate matters, Sami, a popular young Arab boy in school, starts paying attention to her and she develops a powerful crush on him. While her fellow veiled classmates argue with teachers about their desire to keep wearing the hijab, and her parents argue about her wearing hers, Mariam dreams of Sami, despite her best friend Sophia\u2019s warning that he is not serious. Things come to a head when the deadline for removing the hijab or facing expulsion falls the same week Mariam sees Sami with another girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kZ342heLL5lpS7NyUH3Tb8OkWiA.jpg", "actors": ["Oulaya Amamra (Mariam)", "Lou Levy (Sophia)", "Ahmed Hafiene (Le p\u00e8re)", "Louka Masset (Karim)", "Soumay\u00e9 Bocoum (Fatimata)", "Fadila Belkebla (Mariam' Stepmother)", "Natalie Beder (The Teacher)", "Ahmed Afiene (Mariam's Father)", "Eric Herson-Macarel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
