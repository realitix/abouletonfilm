And here you have it, the band's final live performance from San Diego's Westin Hotel Ballroom, marking the end of an era and the affirmation of their cemented presence in the slightly emptier world of rock n' roll. Filmed Oct. 31st 2005 in San Diego, CA.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2IBceA04d9VnepjV4U2Wu4czUEM.jpg", "actors": ["John Reis (Speedo)", "Pete Reichert (Petey X)", "Andy Stamets (ND)", "Paul O'Beirne (Apollo 9)", "Jason Crane (JC 2000)", "Mario Rubalcaba (Ruby Mars)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "J09oMedFDVs"}
