Those traditions have been passed along from generation to generation by kahuna (priests and sages) and kumu hula (master teachers). In this film, shot at exotic locations throughout the islands, Vicky Holt Takamine and other respected kumu hula reveal ancient traditions that have survived, flourished, and (where appropriate) evolved in spite of attempts by Nineteenth Century missionaries, plantation owners and US Marines to repress Hawai'i's indigenous culture. Together, these two films present Hawaiian art and life as few outsiders have seen it: rich, expressive, colorful and utterly unique. In 2015, both films were transferred to HD video from their original 16mm and stereo audio masters and lovingly restored.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lBLUHUaGYHpMlueLHxF1QqqJ4N2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
