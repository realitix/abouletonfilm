She returns to her old home in Louisiana, where she proceeds to drink quite steadily and to drive away five personal attendants in the first twenty minutes of the movie. Then she meets with Chantelle, whose stubbornness matches her own -- if only because Chantelle, herself a recovering cocaine addict, cannot afford to lose this job. Their mutual dislike gradually develops into an armed truce as the two women deal with their own problems and with each others'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xiDasTZfOZ0jEZ6O3NiapeVzUIV.jpg", "actors": ["Mary McDonnell (May-Alice Culhane)", "Alfre Woodard (Chantelle)", "Lenore Banks (Nurse Quick)", "Angela Bassett (Rhonda / Dawn)", "Vondie Curtis-Hall (Sugar LeDoux)", "David Strathairn (Rennie)", "Nora Dunn (Ti-Marie)", "Tom Wright (Luther)", "Leo Burmester (Reeves)", "Michael Mantell (Dr. Kline)", "Marianne Muellerleile (Drushka)", "Maggie Renzi (Louise)", "Amanda Carlin (Perky)", "Sheila Kelley (Kim)", "Mary Portser (Precious)", "Nancy Mette (Nina)", "Michael Laskin (Redwood Vance)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47944, 31944], "youtube_key": "RsugtjWFMeQ"}
