This isolated part of the country finds itself in the middle of the referendum for or against the EU. Our characters couldn't care less - they are absorbed in their problems. The young football player who accidentally killed his mother doesn't want to join a rich foreign football team and is willing to risk his father's love because of it. The lonely fat girl is so desperate for a friend and for a lover that she will end up seeking both in the pig-sty. The miser peasant will find out that the real misery is in loneliness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pvMD9Nmc8tWTEGwePcqXjMhd2Uc.jpg", "actors": ["Kre\u0161imir Miki\u0107 (Mike)", "Areta \u0106urkovi\u0107 (Olga)", "Ivo Gregurevi\u0107 (Joso)", "Danko Lju\u0161tina (Miketov otac)", "Jasna \u017dalica (Josina \u017eena)", "Nada Ga\u0107e\u0161i\u0107 (Teta)", "Milan Ple\u0161tina (Doktor)", "Dara Vuki\u0107 (Baba)", "Marija Tadi\u0107 (Jele)", "Milivoj Beader (Iguman)", "Damir Karaka\u0161 (Gli\u0161o)", "Petar Tu\u0111a (Gli\u0161o)", "Trpimir Jurki\u0107 (Mladi policajac)", "Filip Rado\u0161 (Stariji policajac)", "Mirela Brekalo (Mikeova mati)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
