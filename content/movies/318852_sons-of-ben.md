They were a group without a team to root for and had a modest goal of reaching 100 members by the end of the year. Little did they know they would reach over 1,500 members in less time than that and start a movement that would not only change the soccer landscape in Philadelphia forever, but also help revive a community that had been struggling for decades.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s3wEKVM27924BjKISazoYa2MhcD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [201666, 309208, 364306], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
