Well, look no further. Over the course of these three marvelous videos (totaling about 160 minutes and over 40 songs, including repeats), we are nearly overwhelmed by the charm, charisma, and sheer talent that made Elvis Presley so extraordinarily popular and influential. There are songs from television shows (emphasizing the mid-'50s appearances that helped cement his iconic status), concerts, and movies, along with interviews, some revealing (mostly silent) home movies, and photos galore. And by favoring the music Presley made in his earlier years, as well as by loading the videos with complete, uninterrupted performances, executive producer Andrew Solt and company show us how Presley combined country, gospel, and R&B to make rock & roll the most vital pop culture phenomenon of the past 50 years. This is the mother lode, and a must-have for longtime adherents and newcomers alike.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zmZXbZqaUXMgz9q3Rm8FELNQ0KR.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Presley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
