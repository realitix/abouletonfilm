To do so, he has taken on the guise that is feared throughout the occult world: the righteous hero known as The Monk. Three beautiful sisters, the spawn of a demon, seek to control Johnny's mind, his body, his very soul. Sister Avarice (Lara Daans, Electra) is a corporate lawyer who uses her brains and her body to force Johnny into submission. Sister Anger owns a martial arts school for women, with a hatred of men and special passion for the fairer sex. Sister Lust is everything her name implies, running a high class bordello where a night of pleasure can lead to a lifetime of hell. Only one man can save the world from these bewitching sirens.
