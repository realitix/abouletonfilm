Robert Kramer makes one of the six short films that illustrates the cultural side of the decade Mitt\u00e9rand. Here we see a director of cinema in the suburbs of Caen, in her room lined with flower paper. This for art and essay cinema. There, the critic Serge Daney in a sailor's cap, for a chat by the fire. An overview of French cinema today, \"Pickpocket\" on television. Then back on you. The camera slides on the desk that we imagine to be Kramer's. Finally, the camera flies over Paris, slides along the facades, stops on a window, entering the skylight: \"The films invite to see ... I invite you to see Jean Genet's hotel room.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Nicole Belguise ()", "Michel Choquet ()", "Serge Daney ()", "Robert Kramer ()", "B\u00e9atrice Michel ()", "Philippe Tavernier ()", "Genevi\u00e8ve Troussier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
