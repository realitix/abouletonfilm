We have white picket fences in front of which a hen slowly struts as the film opens and a housewife in a long dress and white bonnet coming out to buy stamps from a bow-tied postman who has delivered a letter to her mailbox.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
