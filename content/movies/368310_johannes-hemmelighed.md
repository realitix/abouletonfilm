Before going to bed he wants his mother to read something from the Bible for him, instead of one of the usual stories from Superman. She reads some lines from the Revelation of St. John. Johannes asks her what \"the end is near\" means. She explains that it is when Jesus comes back, and sends the good people to Paradise and the evil ones to Hell. In the middle of the night Johannes sees a dazzling light and lots of water pouring out from the toilet. Suddenly an androgynous being is standing in the bathroom. Johannes thinks it's Jesus, and the being doesn't deny it. Johannes asks Jesus if his parents are going to Hell, as he thinks they are evil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/umls7fU5NyFYgUOIDpRgTrxL5pY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
