Enter the magical world of virginity, where a white wedding dress can restore a woman's innocence and replacement hymens can be purchased online. Filmmaker Therese Shechter uses her own path out of virginity to explore why our sex-crazed society cherishes this so-called precious gift. Along the way, we meet sex educators, virginity auctioneers, abstinence advocates, and young men and women who bare their tales of doing it-or not doing it. \"How To Lose Your Virginity\" uncovers the myths and misogyny surrounding a rite of passage that many obsesses about but few truly understand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xD7nEVJFN08cScafFD9h8jomq5r.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
