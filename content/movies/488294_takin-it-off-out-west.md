At one town the patriarch of a grungy outlaw family discovers that the girls are getting $500 a day from the government, and decides to kidnap the trio and hold them for ransom. Unfortunately, he uses his two idiot sons in his scheme, and things don't go off exactly as planned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ihAdADrT4lC4ZlC3PYV4XyV5Z31.jpg", "actors": ["Julie Strain (Mad Mary)", "Anastasia Brown (Genevieve)", "Kathy Pasmore (Catastrophe Kate)", "Taylor St. Claire (Busty)", "George Buck Flower (Pappy Putz)", "John F.
