The peaceful life of an old lady, in a village on the seaside, is disturbed by a sudden confrontation with the fragility of life. This moment sends her back into her past to seek out the meaning of existence. But the arrival of her niece and her children will all of a sudden fill this gap. The filmmaker says: \u201cMy film is an intergenerational love letter between niece and grandmother, an ebb and flow between dreams and reality, between past and present, between the magic of childhood and the encounter with death.\u201d Old age, time that flies by. Youth, time that remains slow.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
