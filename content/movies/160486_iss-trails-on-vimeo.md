A tiny white spot, as it can be seen racing over the sky from time to time, when illuminated by the sunset (and sunrise ;).\r This Video was achived by \"stacking\" image sequences provided by NASA from the Crew at International Space Station (see also fragileoasis.org/blog/2012/3/on-the-trails-of-stars/). These \"stacks\" create the Star Trails, but furthermore make interesting patterns visible. For example lightning corridors within clouds, but they also show occasional satellite tracks (or Iridium Flashes) as well as meteors - patterns that interrupt the main Star Trails, and thus are immediately visible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a8IrdIRN5FWo4Kre4bRDRnrzNFT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
