Instead of focusing on the object of the Wall, \"Palestine Blues\" examines the grassroots resistance movement that has sprung up against it. 'Palestine Blues' is not a 'traditional' political reportage but rather an interminable road trip across hard and liquid borders, across a terrain that is being erased as it is being traversed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vNNFx0JwGdBIsTf4ATz6cVduI6Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
