The smart but naughty farmhands son's eternal mischief, pranks and disobedience drive his elders (especially teachers, family and father's grumpy employer, a rich farmer, but also neighbors and even the kind curate whose liturgical server he is) and classmates to despair in a time when a boy's punishment was still inevitable, swift and often severe; thus when his mother catches him skinny dipping she takes all his clothes home, forcing him to a long walk of shame, dreading dad's wrath all the way. This version also stresses the story's social and Flamingant aspects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r782U1gQRk2cVpldBDMi5oyGJHu.jpg", "actors": ["Clerckx Eric (Louis Verheyden/De Witte)", "Willy Vandermeulen (Vader van de Witte)", "Blanka Heirman (Moeder van de Witte)", "Blanka Heirman (Pastoor Munte)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
