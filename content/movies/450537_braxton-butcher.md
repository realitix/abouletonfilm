For the small community of Braxton, that devil is Tommy Miller. A bullied and tormented teen who finally snapped, killing his friends and family at the annual Braxton town hall party, Miller escaped into the woods, never to be seen or heard from again. Until now. Ten years later, a group of fresh-faced teens find themselves targeted by a masked man in a hooded cloak. It's up to Detective Ryan Fenton and his fish-out-of-water partner to protect the town from Miller's clutches; there's just one issue - Ryan himself is a survivor of the original massacre. Is Miller opening up a new chapter, or has he returned to attend to some unfinished business?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/15xqY2g9KAYn23YYrmX2CBJTUhN.jpg", "actors": ["Shaun Blaney (Ryan Fenton)", "Vicky Allen (Claudia)", "Rachel Morton (Sarah)", "Diona Doherty (Kaitlin)", "Andrew Stanford (Will Gilbert)", "Ciaran McCourt (Danny)", "Joshua Colquhoun (Ethan)", "Philip Rafferty (Oliver)", "Odhran McNulty (Dean)", "Brandon McCaffrey (Ronnie)", "Natalie Curran (Alicia)", "Stephen Foster (Deputy Holland)", "Larry Cowan (Detective Walton)", "Stephanie Donaghue (Cora)", "Meabh McAuley (Annabelle)", "Ois\u00edn Cash (Tommy Miller)", "Rachel Murray (Mrs. Miller)", "Shane McCaffrey (Mr. Miller)", "Rory Lindsay (Detective Tramer)", "Melissa McGuigan (Elise)", "Eoin Feighan (Radio Host)", "Keith Thanni (Radio Station Engineer)", "Nathan Hughes (News Reporter Glen Engel)", "Seaneen Moorehead (Mrs. Lewis)", "Tara Greene (Laura)", "Erin O'Rawe (Sally)", "Christopher Paul Heath (Gerry, Crime Scene Reporter)", "Catherine Brennan (Julie's Mum)", "Lewis McArthur (Radio Caller)", "Felicity McKee (Student)", "Jenna Byrne (Julie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "k4ywPKj7m18"}
