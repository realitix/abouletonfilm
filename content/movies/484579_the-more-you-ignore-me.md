The film focuses on Gina, a young mother, whose efforts to be a loving mother and wife are undermined by her declining mental health. Things deteriorate when she develops an obsession with the local weatherman, which leads to an admission to the nearby psychiatric hospital. Over the years, as she grows up, her daughter Alice struggles to relate to her heavily medicated mum, and causes chaos when she comes up with a plan to reconnect with her, which divides the family forever and leads to a moving climax. Set to the songs of The Smiths, The More You Ignore Me provides a sometimes stark, yet comical insight into life within this quirky household, whilst addressing mental health issues and their impact on the family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8X6wiZpYO6tcecjqSZ53M7RyQG.jpg", "actors": ["Sheridan Smith (Gina Wilson)", "Mark Addy (Keith Wilson)", "Ella Hunt (Alice Wilson)", "Sally Phillips (Dr Marie Henty)", "Ricky Tomlinson (Bert Wildgoose)", "Sheila Hancock (Nan Wildgoose)", "Jo Brand (Sandra)", "Alexander Morris (Mark)", "Clive Mantle (Dunk)", "Tony Way (Wobbly Wildgoose)", "Tom Davis (Big Head Wildgoose)", "Roger Morlidge (Phil)", "Elizabeth Carling (Jean)", "Rosie Akerman (Karen)", "Eloise Groom (Young Alice)", "Nadine Hanwell (Mrs. Langforth)", "Daniel Coll (Jim)", "Lewis Fletcher (Ted Fairfax)", "Dennis Conlon (Taxi Driver)", "Ashley Taylor Dawson (Dr Desmond)", "Nadine Hanwell (Mrs Longforth)", "John Fagan (Security Guard)", "Rod Glenn (Ambulance Driver)", "Jamie Thurston (Look North Presenter)", "Jeannie Calandar (Female Customer)", "Frank Gray (Vicar)", "Tony Blackburn (Top of the Pops Presenter (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [550216, 556173, 561269, 505204], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
