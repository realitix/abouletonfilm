Amid rare footage of the most shocking and inspired street acts from around the world, one performer after another pulls back the makeshift curtain. Their acts are astonishing; their stories, more amazing still. Here is the tightrope walker, the razor blade muncher, the sidewalk samurai, the tattooed man. Meet The Fireman who lost his teeth to his fire-eating act, and the Calypso Tumbler who's buying up real estate in the Caribbean. This is the human condition at its most freakishly wonderful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tLKA1qjlYLQenm4a15q7tc9w3S5.jpg", "actors": ["The Amazing Johnathan (Himself)", "Robert Shields (Himself)", "Jim Rose (Himself)", "Michael Moschen (Himself)", "Michael Davis (Himself)", "A.
