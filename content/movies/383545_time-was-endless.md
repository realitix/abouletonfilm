There he lives on the outskirts of the city with his sister and her sick child in a barren single room, and supports them through working various jobs. The environment is far from welcoming, but Anderson is driven by a burgeoning awareness of his two-spirited sexuality, which he feels can only be realized in the anonymity of the city. Anderson finds himself in limbo, questioning and rejecting certain tribal rituals, even as he fiercely defends his community and seeks to find peace with his identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e4sZdtec1XjQDfv1hwNqgCA3lxq.jpg", "actors": ["Anderson Tikuna (Anderson)", "Severiano Kedassere (Velho Paj\u00e9)", "Fidelis Baniwa (Tunar\u00ea)", "Kay Sara (Irm\u00e3)", "Beg\u00ea Muniz (Beto)", "Rita Carelli (Pia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "y2A05vSXrUY"}
