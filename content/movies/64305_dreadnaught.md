One person he unsuccessfully tries to kill several times is a cowardly laundry man named \"Mousy\" who manages to escape mostly by running and hiding. When a very close friend of Mousy's is killed by the White Tiger, Mousy overcomes his cowardliness enough to seek revenge. Spectacular martial arts and acrobatics highlight the film, including a well choreographed fight between two pairs of men in dragon costume.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ag5eCwLN78wWLhyVK3bR5E6Uu6r.jpg", "actors": ["Yuen Biao (Mousy)", "Leung Kar-Yan (Leung Foon)", "Kwan Tak-Hing (Wong Fei-Hung)", "Philip Ko (Tam King)", "Yuen Shun-Yi (White Tiger)", "Lily Li Li-Li (Mousy's sister)", "Tong Ching (Mousy's love interest)", "Fan Mei-Sheng (Marshal Pao)", "Brandy Yuen (Marshal's assistant)", "Yuen Cheung-Yan (Marshal's assistant)", "Fung Hak-On (Demon Tailor)", "Danny Chow (Gorgeous Koon)", "Chiu Chung-Hing (Ah Qi)", "San Kuai (Iron Swallow)", "Yuen Lung-Kui ()", "Yuen Qiu (White Tiger's wife)", "Lee Chun-Wa (Biggie (Big Mouth))", "Yue Tau-Wan (Snake Tongue, local Police)", "Fung Ging-Man (Opens Lion Dance)", "Sai Gwa-Pau (Hung's servant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [40832], "youtube_key": "rUZd-90MrAM"}
