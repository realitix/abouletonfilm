When the car finally pulls over, the driver gets out and shoots at them, killing one of the officers in cold blood. A national alert is issued and an extensive search for the ruthless killer begins, with the Beck group at the lead.  Neither the officer\u2019s shocked and wounded colleague nor any of the witnesses have seen anything helpful to the police. Finally, they find the car registration number using a surveillance camera. But, when they enter the car owner\u2019s apartment, they find him shot to death.  The first day of summer is a long one for the Beck group, as the killer has more victims on his list.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eQJF9j5VJ6WqrtLsvQY8sIZKRRb.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Haber (Martin Beck)", "Kristofer Hivju (Steinar Hovland)", "M\u00e5ns Nathanaelson (Oskar Bergman)", "Jonas Karlsson (Klas Fred\u00e9n)", "Ingvar Hirdwall (Grannen)", "Rebecka Hemse (Inger)", "Elmira Arikan (Ayda Cetin)", "\u00c5sa Karlin (Bergstr\u00f6m)", "Anu Sinisalo (Gunilla Urst)", "Tommy W\u00e4ttring (Vilhelm)", "Simon J.
