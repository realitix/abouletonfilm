Here, hundreds of thousands of children are raising children and are left to fend for themselves in a cruel and frightening world. This is not a fairy tale. This kingdom is Swaziland, Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy. It has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the world, leaving 1/3 of its population orphaned or vulnerable. Without radical intervention to this preventable disease, there will be NO ADULTS in Swaziland by the year 2030. NEVER A NEVERLAND documents the reality of a kingdom moving towards extinction and the hope of a people working to ensure that Swaziland never becomes a 'Neverland'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9X7UuTKaohd7Rv08XWE82DUdJfb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
