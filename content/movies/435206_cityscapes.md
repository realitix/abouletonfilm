Social and architectural constructions are fragmented and dashing past. Cityscapes attempts to make archived recordings from the Austrian Film Museum legible along these lines. Single images are isolated from the cinematographic flow in order to scrutinize their inscribed cognitive potential. For Walter Benjamin, history disintegrates into images and not stories. Cityscapes is a search along the tracks of these images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qnRKklUlENCz4RKVpqTdwW8SKRS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
