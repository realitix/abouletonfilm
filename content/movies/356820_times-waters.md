Such an enterprise gets two villages in conflict over water rights, threatening to permanently turn people against each other. In the past, the territory had been occupied by the Italian armies, and a flashback shows a massacre in one village, a revelation that disaster has been a part of their history, in one way or another. No matter how he argues, the young man who advocated the watermill loses out to the builders of a dam - something that does not bode well for the low-lying village.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o0KqKySNmXTAikTKNSWpcK01ebK.jpg", "actors": ["Petre Arsovski (Petre Kjusko)", "Du\u0161an Kostovski (Korun)", "\u0160i\u0161man Angelovski (Spiridonie Tolusumot)", "Nenad Milosavljevi\u0107 (Pop Trifile)", "Lidija Pletl (Veljanica)", "Boris Dvornik (Narednik \u017dika)", "Petar Prli\u010dko (Lambe Futak)", "Milan \u0160trlji\u0107 (Altan)", "Meto Jovanovski (Dudule)", "Zvonko Lepeti\u0107 (Pitropot Medo\u0161an)", "Petar Temelkovski (Ga\u0161o)", "Firdaus Nebi (Teofil)", "Salaetin Bilal (Komandant)", "Pan\u010de Kamd\u017eik (Pantelej)", "Du\u0161an Jani\u0107ijevi\u0107 (Jak)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
