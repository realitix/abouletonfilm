Hoolboom's dance with death \u2014 a motif acknowledged in the medieval woodcut segues between segments \u2014 resonates in double-exposed shots of anonymous people simply crossing a square, some of them \"real,\" others shown as faint, literal \"ghosts\" coexisting with those still in the temporal present. In voiceover Hoolboom talks about the \"conspiracy of chromosomes\" that make up the human being, but the phrase is ironic; for him, nothing is more real, or human, or felt, than what that conspiracy has created.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wea6ADfCf0JTxt7r6vI4hIFox2l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
