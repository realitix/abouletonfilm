To entertain and inspire his fellow prisoners, he tells the story of becoming a man in 1919, the year he realized that learning to live is the same as learning to die. His stiff and demanding father loses a fortune in German war bonds, takes a job in Caspe, and leaves Jos\u00e9 on his own in Zaragoza to finish high school while apprenticing in a pharmacy. Jos\u00e9 courts his beloved Valentina via letters, becomes intimate with Isabel, a maid he meets in a cinema who shares his ideas of free love, and comes under the influence of El Checa, an anarchist and gentle teacher who leads a doomed revolt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sfsirYwvco8IMWsmsXzeX3zXUS5.jpg", "actors": ["Miguel Molina ()", "Cristina Marsillach ()", "Walter Vidarte ()", "Antonio Betancourt (Letux)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
