With that success comes unique and exciting opportunities, like the chance to perform at the famed Farm Aid benefit\u2026 with its founders.  That\u2019s what happened on this day in 1998, when Phish joined forces with Neil Young for an extended sit-in at Farm Aid that also featured a sit-in on \u201cMoonlight in Vermont\u201d from Willie Nelson and Paul Schaffer. After a few original songs, Young made his first appearance with the band after a \u201cRunaway Jim\u201d segued into \u201cArc.\u201d Phish and Neil Young then played \u201cDown By The River,\u201d before the guest-filled \u201cMoonlight in Vermont\u201d came next in the set.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nzOX9LpRiPGNAzl0l7yhDo22xB1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
