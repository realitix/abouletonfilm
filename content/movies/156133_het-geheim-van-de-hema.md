It's all about expansion, even as far as China. But do foreign countries really need quintessentially Dutch concepts such as uniform pricing, the classic HEMA smoked sausages and timeless ladies' dresses?  Chinese filmmaker Yan Ting Yuen, who came to the Netherlands at the age of six, followed the passionate CEO for a year, trying to find out what makes HEMA so unique. It turns out to be about more than just smoked sausages, as shown by the success of the new stores in France, where customers stuff their baskets with coffee mugs and Dutch syrup waffles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tQpsSUyG9lVrD1Typnqs8srtDA7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "iX8ZdQf-4ZQ"}
