Its quite a long gap for a follow up film, but the original cast has returned and directed by 'The Muppets' famed filmmaker. So, I was not expecting it since I considered the first film an average. All I wanted was a normal live-action 'Alice in Wonderland' films, but I disliked this weird make-ups and large head characters. In that perspective, this one was much better. Still, this is not the best, but definitely a lot better than the previous one.\r\n\r\nA simple adventure story with nice graphics and performances. The Alice returns to the Wonderland for a new adventure where she has to cross the layers of the present, past and future. So in one word, this is a time travel theme in the fantasy genre. Mia Wasikowska ruled it, she was everywhere. She overran all other characters and takes the toughest challenge to achieve impossible.\r\n\r\nNearly a two hour journey into wonderland might make happy for little kids. Because it did not look like a normal fairytale, but very modern. This is not the Disney's best film, so I don't think there will be any more sequel. I want it to be rebooted, but not any time soon, at least a decade of gap needed. So I hope they won't rush and ruin this classic tale like three 'Spiderman' reboots in less than 20 years. Meantime, this film is okay for watching once, though I'm not in favour to recommend it to anybody except little children.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [12155, 283366, 290595, 278154]}
