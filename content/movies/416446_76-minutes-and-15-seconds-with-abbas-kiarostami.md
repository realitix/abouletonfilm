Filmmaker and close friend Samadian avoids the talking heads of so many artistic memoirs to offer more candid clips of Kiarostami the man: lover of poetry, convivial with friends, engaging landscapes on and off screen, laughing with other artists. The artist and visionary emerges more clearly but so does a loving, wondrous man whom we will miss now as much as the auteur.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xJJYyoid8aTvkPQU7NWds4wwFK2.jpg", "actors": ["Abbas Kiarostami (Himself)", "Jafar Panahi (Himself)", "Ali Reza Raiesian (Himself)", "Tahereh Ladanian (Herself)", "Juliette Binoche (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
