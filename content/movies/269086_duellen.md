A medical student (Frits Helmuth) earns money for tuition working in a burlesque joint. He falls for one of the girls (Malene Schwarz), but she is also involved with a movie director (John Price). The director and Helmuth get into a philosophical debate about love and Darwinism, and the film ends with a duel (the film's title). Duellen was met with mostly incomprehension when it premiered and is no more lucid when viewed today. The striptease scene featuring full-frontal nudity is tame by modern standards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nBKXhCEEfP3xMIRRUJcqWMnSnb2.jpg", "actors": ["Frits Helmuth ()", "John Price ()", "Axel Str\u00f8bye ()", "Hans Kurt ()", "Buster Larsen ()", "Vera Gebuhr ()", "Albert Watson ()", "Ulla Darni ()", "Elith Pio ()", "Poul M\u00fcller ()", "Karl Stegger ()", "Aage Winther-J\u00f8rgensen ()", "Minna J\u00f8rgensen ()", "Poul Thomsen ()", "Knud Rex ()", "Maxine ()", "Malene Schwartz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
