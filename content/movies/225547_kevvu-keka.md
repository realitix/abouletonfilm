He lives with his uncle Abrakadabra Appa Rao (Krishna Bhagawan), who is a magician. Buchi Raju happens to come across Maha Lakshmi (Sharmila Mandre) one fine day and falls in love with her. Maha Lakshmi also responds to Buchi Babu and they fall in love.  Maha Lakshmi\u2019s father Subba Rao (M.S.Narayana) does not approve of this alliance as Buchi Raju is not a rich guy. To win Maha Lakshmi\u2019s hand, Buchi Raju promises to earn a lot of money within 6 months and leaves.  What happens next? Will Buchi Raju succeed in his efforts? That forms the story of this film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s5nVMkv3bXiUjcdFpmUDo5MgT4G.jpg", "actors": ["Allari Naresh (Buchi Raju)", "Sharmila Mandre (Maha Lakshmi)", "Mumaith Khan ()", "Krishna Bhagavan ()", "Khayyum ()", "Ali ()", "M.
