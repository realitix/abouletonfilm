It was the first time the singer offered live versions of sings from his celebrated Talking Heads days since that band stopped touring eight years ago....Some of this material had never before been performed live.  Twisting a full continent of sound into an unnameable shape, Byrne's group combines everything from samba and mambo to R&amp;B and pop.  Despite a considerable history to live up to, Byrne proved at this show that he has never been better.\" - New York Daily News.  Play List...  1. Well  2. (Nothing But) Flowers  3.
