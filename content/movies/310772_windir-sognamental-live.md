The group disbanded after front man Terje \"Valfar\" Bakken's tragic death, but this 2004 concert -- a tribute to the late singer -- recorded live at Rockefeller Palace in Oslo, Norway, is a gem. Also featured are additional live footage, backstage scenes and an interview with Valfar.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
