However, not all is well among the ten residents of 'Little Star Pension': each dialogue line from every hotel guest is evidence that he, or her, has a reason (actually, more than one) to hate Neves - to the point of wishing him dead. Carelessness (or devious intention) by one party will provide the means; another, will create the propitious moment; yet another, and then the rest of them will create the festive New Year's Eve occasion - to do with Neves forever! Obviously, only the famous world private-eye H\u00e9rcules Pir\u00f4t can solve the crime... for which he is called by phone, even before the deed is done.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wAZJsl3tgrpIdNpeJly8PBSyZ8w.jpg", "actors": ["Herman Jos\u00e9 ()", "Herman Jos\u00e9 (H\u00e9rcules Pir\u00f4)", "Ana Bola (C\u00e9lia)", "Canto e Castro (Neves)", "Jos\u00e9 Pedro Gomes (Lacerda)", "L\u00eddia Franco (Preciosa)", "Maria Vieira (Estrelinha)", "Nuno Melo (Bruno)", "Rita Blanco (T\u00f3nia)", "S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Lapa (Lita Gomes)", "Victor de Sousa (Lelo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QIEmOeia8Jg"}
