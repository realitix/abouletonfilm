Helene, who crosses the junction on her motor scooter every day, has taken a shine to Fritz a long while ago. Although Fritz yields right-of-way to her remarkably often, the two have not spoken to each other. In order to finally get to know him better, Helene deliberately performs a traffic violation. Her plan is working: She is ordered to take road safety education lessons from Fritz and they get closer. New problems arise in the shape of Mrs. Messmer who must pay a monetary fine. She feels discriminated against by Fritz and complains about him to his supervisor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ljAUR7FBQjyGhpvImx201bp1JZw.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf Herricht (Fritz Bachmann)", "Karin Schr\u00f6der (Helene Br\u00e4uer)", "Marianne W\u00fcnscher (Frau Messmer)", "Gerd Ehlers (Herr Simmel)", "Carola Braunbock (Nachbarin)", "Mathilde Danegger (Mutter Hirsch)", "Peter Dommisch (L\u00f6rke)", "Johannes Maus (Ekel)", "Sabine Thalbach (Dame im VPKA)", "Jochen Thomas (Hauptmann Gabler)", "Werner Lierck (Werbeleiter)", "Siegfried G\u00f6hler ()", "Rudolf Donath ()", "Walter Kainz ()", "Rudolf Fleck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
