They take turns trying to impress her, with such stunts as skywriting hearts (Cecil almost drowns) and fancy dives (Cecil almost crashes, then gets into a fight with a shark, a turtle, and a starfish).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/byum7axl7M3hknynmOEoGz4wK7S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
