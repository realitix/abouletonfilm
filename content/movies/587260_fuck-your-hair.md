Married brewery owners Andres Araya and Mila Ramirez, Latin American immigrants, rejoiced when they were selected to brew the house brand for the new Trump Tower, a coup for such a small business.  Joy turned to horror with Trump\u2019s shocking public characterizations of Hispanic immigrants.  They pulled their beer out of the tower, but what to do with all that product?  The answer lay in imaginative relabeling of the golden ale as Chinga Tu Pelo, or F\u2022\u2022\u2022 Your Hair.  Thirsty Chicago beer drinkers, bar owners and restaurateurs rose to the protest challenge with glee, and set 5 Rabbit on a new path to social action.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
