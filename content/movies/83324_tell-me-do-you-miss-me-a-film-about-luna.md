Laced with moments of both humour and melancholia, tell me do you miss me earnestly exposes the underbelly of a touring rock band in their final days together.  Supported sonically with Luna's dreamy catalog of indie pop and visually with lush travelogue footage with adventurous stops in England, Japan and Spain.
