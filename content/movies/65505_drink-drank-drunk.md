Unsatisfied with spending her days as a beer girl, the ambitious Siu Min becomes Michael's partner in the restaurant business, and eventually falls in love with him. Michael, however, must reconcile his dream of traveling the world with his other dream of running a successful restaurant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aBTfIW3cBdSZaDbdOG9RtNLcmEr.jpg", "actors": ["Miriam Yeung (Siu-Man)", "Daniel Wu (Michael / 'Michel')", "Alex Fong Chung-Sun (Brother Nine)", "Vincent Kok (Siu Min's gay hotpot boss)", "Ella Koon (Yan Loh)", "Renee Dai (Rene)", "Hu Jing (Zhao Jie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [67793], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
