In 2005, in an audacious bid to do just that, NASA scientists launched a space probe to collide with a comet in the emptiness of deep space. This film follows the amazing story of mission Deep Impact, from its inception through to the final nail-biting moments when the probe and comet Tempel 1 met head-on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvAVxG9kVdPc8bH0RvVtmyeyalu.jpg", "actors": ["Brennan Brown (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
