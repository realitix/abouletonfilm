We follow Willard, an insurance adjuster who finds himself on one crazy adventure after another with one crazy duck. The music is great, the jokes (while dated) are very funny,and while the animation quality may not be as good as many of Ralph Bakshi's films, I found this far more entertaining than Fritz the Cat. Its a must see for those who love the more twisted films of the 70's."}], "recommandations_id": [2097, 85860]}
