A poor man's Mad Mad Mad Mad World.\r\n\r\n\"Was it interesting?\" That was the best part. The story is complex, characters were developed with reasonable motivations. It's just the transition to a movie that didn't really do it justice.\r\n1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n\"Was it entertaining?\" The comedy was slightly humorous in parts, but mostly predictable or too drawn out.\r\n1 out of 3\r\n\r\n\"Was it memorable?\" The locations were pretty well done, and the acting was better than the dialog. The problem is that pacing was so slow I almost fell asleep 2/3 through and was wanting to fast-forward in the last 5 minutes.\r\n1 out of 3\r\n\r\n1.5+1+1=3.5+1(default 1)=4.5\r\nRound up or down for overall feeling and this feels like a 4. This is not a movie I would want to see and felt like my time was somewhat wasted."}], "recommandations_id": [42470, 12535, 10970, 22998], "youtube_key": "Wt1lHyuTDWE"}
