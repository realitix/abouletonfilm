People wrapped in fear could not think of anything but pray that another Leon Guerrero would come in and save them. Manuel (Lito Lapid), a meek son of a drunkard was chosen to play the role of the next Leon Guerrero. His appearance adds and strengthens the anger of Gancho (George Estregan), the leader of the bandits. Harder to believe but at the end, everybody has to. It is not impossible for anyone to be a Hero.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lito Lapid ()", "Josephine Manuel ()", "George Estregan ()", "Paquito Diaz ()", "Maritess De Joya ()", "Lito Anzures ()", "Victor Bravo ()", "Max Alvarado ()", "Bobby Clinton ()", "Allan Dare ()", "Ben Dato ()", "Luz Fernandez ()", "Rocco Montalban ()", "Bomber Moran ()", "Robert Rivera ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
