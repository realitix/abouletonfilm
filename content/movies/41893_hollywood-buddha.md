Philippe is struggling to sell a film he made five years ago to foreign distributors. Nearly broke, and on the verge of eviction, he seeks spiritual help from Master Atchoum, a Buddhist Guru. Master Atchoum pushes him into practicing Buddhism and convinces him to buy an expensive metal sculpture of Buddha. Empowered by the support of his new-found \"religion,\" Philippe starts turning things around. Through a series of serendipitous events...and some very unorthodox maneuvering, he becomes a success.
