Joseph's heart belongs to a country girl, foundling Fanny Goodwill, but his masters take him on a fashionable trip to Bath, where the spoiled society comes mainly to see and be seen, but drowns in the famous Roman baths. When the all but grieving lady finds Joseph's Christian virtue and true love resist her lusting passes just as well as the many ladies who fancy her footman, she fires the boy. He's found and nursed by an innkeeper's maid, which stirs lusts there, again besides his honorable conduct, but is found by the good parson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2qqPAUmJPqMXlLMMfpdKMbpYslM.jpg", "actors": ["Ann-Margret (Lady Booby alias \"Belle\")", "Peter Firth (Joseph Andrews)", "Michael Hordern (Parson Adams)", "Beryl Reid (Mrs. Slipslop)", "Jim Dale (The pedlar)", "Natalie Ogle  (Fanny Ogle)", "Peter Bull (Sir Thomas Booby)", "Kenneth Cranham (The Wicked Squire)", "Karen Dotrice (Pamela)", "James Villiers (Mr. Booby)", "Penelope Wilton (Mrs. Wilton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
