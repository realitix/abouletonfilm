When the Philosopher, Alidoro, later takes Cenerentola (dressed in magnificent clothing) to the palace, Dandini (still posing as the prince) tries to talk of love to her, but Cenerentola rejects him, saying that she is in love with his 'valet'. Ramiro, who has overheard this comment, is overjoyed, and immediately proposes to her, but Cenerentola says that he must first seek her out and then, if he still felt the same way, she would marry him. She gives him one of a matching pairs of bracelets, telling him to look for its companion on her right arm (she then leaves the palace). Ramiro ends the masquerade, and he and Dandini resume their true identities. The Prince then sets out on his quest - little realising that destiny, in the form of a violent thunderstorm, is about to take a hand in the affair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lNf08AAt8HbOQwjxhFfXJ6lAFTU.jpg", "actors": ["Frederica von Stade (Angelina / Cenerentola)", "Margherita Guglielmi (Clorinda)", "Laura Zannini (Tisbe)", "Paolo Montarsolo (Don Magnifico)", "Francisco Araiza (Don Ramiro)", "Claudio Desderi (Dandini)", "Paul Plishka (Alidoro)", "Claudio Abbado (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
