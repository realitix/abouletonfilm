On the 4th of May, Mikael and Andrew parted ways with the Three Amigos leaving them to hit the (wrong side) of the road with weary eyes in their all-American GMC SUV.  They travelled through Nevada to the Grand Canyon, with a side trip of nearly 4 hours to the Meteor site around 43 miles east of Flagstaff. In subsequent days, they travelled through Monument Valley, Durango, Buena Vista, Colorado Springs, Santa Fe, Lincoln, Roswell, Tyler, Lubbock, Austin, Mesquite before finally arriving in New Orleans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/59NhtAGVulSAcqXepYf24IhgBBd.jpg", "actors": ["Clint Nielsen (Clintus)", "Wade Halse (Wadels)", "Wesley Joseph (Wesso)", "Clint Nielsen (Randy Tuesday)", "Andrew Starr (Starr)", "Wade's Testicle (Wade's Testicle)", "Bin Laden (Osama Bin Paper)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Clint Nielsen", "content": "It's not often that I'll take time to sit down and watch a 48 minute documentary that insists on in-jokes, suggestive comedy complete with 'you had to be there' sentiment ridiculed throughout a painstakingly boorish American Landscape, to get it's 'lack of a point' across - but this just might be one of those times. \r\n\r\nA soundtrack filled with heart accompanies three buddies travelling from Las Vegas to New Orleans on what appears to be a 'sober' journey that is both soul-searching and eye-widening (in parts).\r\n\r\nIf there's one movie you need to spend your 15 bucks on this summer, this probably isn't it. If you're invited to watch it at a friends house via a free download - sure. I implore you to at least watch the opening titles. They are pretty cool."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MUoUKaqplx8"}
