And the most forceful. The director of The Sorrow and the Pity shares with us stories of his exceptionally rich life in this light-hearted yet bitter escapade though the century and the movies. Son of the great Max Ophuls, he is generous in his admiration. We also meet Jeanne Moreau, Bertolt Brecht, Ernst Lubitsch, Otto Preminger, Woody Allen, Stanley Kubrick and of course Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. There are no great filmmakers without a memory, so here is the memory shop of Marcel Ophuls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dlQCh8U1g1Tzvs4C8M3VEc81rR2.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanne Moreau (Herself)", "Costa-Gavras (Himself)", "Hamilton Fish (Himself)", "Woody Allen (Himself (Archive Material))", "Marcel Oph\u00fcls (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
