It is 1912, and the old man still believes in the old rules which strait-jacket \"men of class.\" He believes that the elite have the right to conquer where they can, that they should refrain from publicizing their improprieties, and he is rabidly pro-military. Adrian, kicked out of his military school for his own improprieties (and hiding that from his father), is naturally drawn to Vicky (Maruschka Detmers) a beautiful divorced woman and friend of the family who is staying at their mansion. The family tutor, a man of ordinary background (with some ideas which seem radical in this household) is similarly smitten. On the basis of their shared attraction, the two men form a friendship. Meanwhile, the object of their affection finds it diverting to toy with them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fZ8yzkcZJtYWAiP7qNGQpeM8eyD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
