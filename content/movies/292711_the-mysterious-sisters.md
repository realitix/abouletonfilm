The heroine(s) remained an action figure, complete with quick wits and agile prowess, but the stories increasingly took on the jewel theft plot and the twilight world of decadent deviance. The Mysterious Sisters is no exception as director Ng Wui renders high class thefts in the style of the classic French film Rififi, and long stretches of action that unfold without dialogue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qPVjW6K9uI6M9G7LnU0Khbyd4QG.jpg", "actors": ["Wu Fung ()", "Suet Nei ()", "Teresa Ha Ping ()", "Lam Tin ()", "Sek Kin ()", "Gam Lui ()", "Wong San ()", "Yeung Chen-sing ()", "Man Man ()", "Unicorn Chan ()", "Petrina Fung Bo-Bo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
