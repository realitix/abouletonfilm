He makes them eat like animals out of food trays, whips and rapes them, and trains them to put on a sex show for his perverted pals (which is how he made his fortune). When the women tire of his erotic abuse, they rise up and brutally murder him onstage to the roaring applause of the amazed audience! Reminiscent of the later BLOODSUCKING FREAKS, the women have all been driven mad by their enforced captivity, making them no better than their dear, departed master in the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y46nSpiYaqvNTaOa6HVn50Vlsch.jpg", "actors": ["Brigit Kr\u00f8yer (Nancy)", "Ray Sebastian (Captor)", "Orla Nsu ()", "Emil Kjaerum ()", "Leif Betheas ()", "Annette Michael (Sex Slave)", "Sandy Dempsey (Sex Slave (uncredited))", "Roger Gentry (Rich Client (uncredited))", "Marland Proctor (Sex Show Viewer (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
