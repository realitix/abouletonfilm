(That said, this reviewer holds Sound Of White Noise above Among The Living, but that's another discussion for another day.) This is Belladonna-era 'Thrax, pre-Public Enemy collaboration, playing some kick-ass metal in front of legions of British fans, their goofy take on thrash in full swing and embodied by Mutant Ninja Turtles and hideous jam shorts and haircuts that they all surely regret. Originally released in 1991 on VHS, this was re-issued on DVD in 2008 and again as part of the Deluxe Edition of Among the Living in 2009.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cIEdxMdESPDjgBbhNrCQjNo0dMT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
