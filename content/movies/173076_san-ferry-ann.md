The campervan family led by Dad and Mum (David Lodge and Joan Sims) create chaos from the moment they set their tires on the shore resulting in frequent run-ins with the Gendarme, while Lewd Grandad (Wilfred Brambell) finds his own misadventures with a newly acquainted friend, a mad German ex-soldier (Ron Moody). Also aboard for the ride is a saucy hitchhiker (Barbara Windsor) who causes a few heads to turn including that of a fellow traveller (Ronnie Stevens) who pursues her affection with comic results. By the end of this weekend the French may well be wishing to say 'au revoir' to these trouble-making tourists. San Ferry Ann is a humorous take on the tradition of the British get-away. A classic sound effect comedy that sits with the likes of similarly praised titles such as 'The Plank', 'Futtock's End' and 'Rhubarb Rhubarb'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g9FH1hWcgIgTBBsEh8XYHedUjsg.jpg", "actors": ["David Lodge (Dad)", "Joan Sims (Mum)", "Wilfrid Brambell (Grandad)", "Lynne Carol (Grandma)", "Barbara Windsor (Hiker girl)", "Ronnie Stevens (Hiker)", "Ron Moody (German)", "Graham Stark (Gendarme)", "Rodney Bewes (Loverboy)", "Catherine Feller (Lover Girl)", "Rodney Bewes (Lover Boy)", "Warren Mitchell (Maitre d'Hotel)", "Aubrey Woods (Immigration Officer)", "Hugh Paddick (French Commercial Traveller)", "Joan Sterndale-Bennett (Madame of Hotel)", "Sandor El\u00e8s (Shop Assistant)", "Fred Emney (Gourmet)", "Thomas Gallagher (Gardener)", "Barrie Gosney (Mini Dad)", "Paul Grist (Ship's Officer)", "Anne Kellett (Mini Mum)", "Bettine Le Beau (War Museum Attendant)", "Andreas Malandrinos (Garage Owner)", "Brian Murphy (Englishman at Garage)", "Henry Woolf (French Taxi Driver)", "Tex Fuller (Onion Seller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
