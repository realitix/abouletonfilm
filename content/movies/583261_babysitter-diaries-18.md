It doesn't take long for Manuel to figure out why!  Kurt calls Alessandra over to help him calm down his crying baby. After the kid gets put to bed, Kurt confesses how hot he finds Alessandra, and it takes off from there.  Lizzie is a crappy babysitter who would rather listen to music than pay attention to Tommy's son. He threatens to fire her, but she makes it up to him.  James hires Emma to watch over him while he attempts to work on a big project because he gets distracted easily. Unfortunately that doesn't last long as Emma can't resist his awkward charm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zh5kBBErgS3FTeMx0pUZQIZjtUn.jpg", "actors": ["Goldie Glock ()", "Alessandra Noir ()", "Lizzie Bell ()", "Emma Ryder ()", "Manuel Ferrara ()", "Kurt Lockwood ()", "Tommy Pistol ()", "James Deen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
