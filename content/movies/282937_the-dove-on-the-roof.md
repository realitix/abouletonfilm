Young, unmarried, self-confident construction manager Linda Hinrichs dedicates herself completely to her work and enjoys living more independently then most women. Daniel, a student works on the construction site to make money during his summer holiday, and impresses Linda with his spontaneous energy and idealism. Brigadier B\u00f6we, an older, divorced man works his way from one construction site to the other and has lost his own personal happiness on the path to developing what was seen as officially suitable social standards. Both men try to win Linda over, not realizing that they are taking her freedom away from her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iVsFiiP9oipkLaBz7yi9IbEHnp9.jpg", "actors": ["Heidemarie Wenzel (Linda Hinrichs)", "G\u00fcnter Naumann (Hans B\u00f6we)", "Andreas Gripp (Daniel)", "Herbert K\u00f6fer (Glaskugelfabrikant)", "Hilmar Baumann (Absatzleiter im Plattenwerk)", "Wolfgang Greese (Forstwirtschaftsleiter)", "Lotte Loebinger (Lindas Mutter)", "Christian Steyer ()", "Monika Lennartz ()", "Heinz Scholz ()", "Katrin Martin ()", "Helmut Gau\u00df ()", "J\u00fcrgen Klau\u00df ()", "Willi Neuenhahn ()", "G\u00fcnter R\u00fcger ()", "Amina Gusner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
