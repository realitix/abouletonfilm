The monotonous thump of a percussively contoured, slightly delayed techno bass line underlies the images which, abstract and mutating constantly defy quick definition. In notdef./version one, virtual objects vigorously grow across a plane and into space from the center of the image for slightly longer than three minutes; nervously assembling and then falling away from one another, they overlap in glaringly bright colors before sinking back into the black matrix.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
