With the help of two enthusiastic New York City theater directors who are not quite sure what awaits them, the troupe is formed among thespians whose skills and minds are not what they once were. As performance day nears, the tension mounts, with the actors battling to overcome crises, as well as themselves. But the show must go on and go on it does, with the troupe clinging to the hope of experiencing the magic and exuberance of performing on stage just one last time. - Sandy Wolf", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fMxFUs27Cd2G09Eqe3zISdfUeU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
