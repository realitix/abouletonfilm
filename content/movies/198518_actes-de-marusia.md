The scene is a small Chilean mining town in 1907. Suffering under the despotic rule of the British mine owners, the workers stage a revolt. The government's solution is to utterly destroy the town rather than allow the rebellion to spread. Letters from Marusia was adapted from a novel by Patricio Manns, which in turn was based on eyewitness accounts of the 1907 massacre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iVHIYd1weYc3v4oQaWzdjckJ7mS.jpg", "actors": ["Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 (Gregorio)", "Diana Bracho (Luisa)", "Patricia Reyes Sp\u00edndola (Rosa)", "Salvador S\u00e1nchez (Sebasti\u00e1n)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [61087, 266212, 102512, 116314], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
