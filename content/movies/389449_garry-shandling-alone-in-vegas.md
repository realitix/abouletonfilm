Shandling's \"average guy stuck in the farce called life\" persona works quite well within the framework of the tape. Casual fans, however, might prefer the Johnny Carson-baiting Shandling of the much-later cable series It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show. Like those two projects, Alone in Vegas began as a Showtime cable special--Shandling's first, in fact.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i01c2K8JdpwYCXaoSjCJSh6Hf9C.jpg", "actors": ["Garry Shandling (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
