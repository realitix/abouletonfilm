The circumstances of his untimely death have never been completely resolved - until now. Unfortunately, the editor's daughter Nina accidentally takes the tape with her to Munich, where she is about to visit her paralyzed Mom in a sanatorium. When this information reaches the CIA and the BND, both organizations compete to get hold of the tape. Meanwhile Erkan &amp; Stefan, two loveable wannabe supercheckers from Munich, are assigned as bodyguards for Nina - of course, they are expected to mess up their job, so that the tape can be retrieved. But the two friends prove to be a bit more streetwise than CIA or BND ever expected.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/56ltfd3ixCOF1HKlrx5bUkVYsxs.jpg", "actors": ["John Friedmann (Erkan)", "Florian Simbeck (Stefan)", "Alexandra Neldel (Nina Eckernf\u00f6rde)", "Manfred Zapatka (Herr Eckernf\u00f6rde, Ninas Vater)", "Christian Tramitz (BND-Mann)", "Anna B\u00f6ttcher (Bunny)", "Tim Wilde (Agent Bendig)", "Siegfried Terpoorten (Manfred Carstens)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [1616, 1615, 10659, 9527], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
