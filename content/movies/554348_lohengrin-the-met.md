Is it possible for a Knight of the Holy Grail to look more enticing than Peter Hofmann? No wonder Elsa (Eva Marton) falls in love at first sight. Marton\u2019s heroine is innocent, but she is also a passionate, real-life young woman\u2014which is good, because Leonie Rysanek is positively demented as Ortrud, the sorceress who accuses Elsa and Lohengrin of using magic. With James Levine\u2019s superb conducting, the orchestra and chorus are similarly magical.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nVrnm0fYUjapwN0Kfp4YRqMyxAB.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Marton ()", "Leonie Rysanek ()", "John Macurdy ()", "Leif Roar ()", "Peter Hofmann ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
