Most of their friends have moved to Buenos Aires, but even if your boyfriend is trying to tug you along, it takes courage (and money in your pocket) to say farewell to each other and the place you have grown up in. But time passes and change happens, no matter if you want it or not - and maybe even Arita and Belencha will one day grow apart. But until then their days are spent talking, dreaming and finding a new home for a cardboard box full of puppies among friends and neighbours.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wNOg4LVtgDiZHc0MLzFj9N5iQaM.jpg", "actors": ["Araceli Castellanos Gotte ()", "Bel\u00e9n Werbach ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
