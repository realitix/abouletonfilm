A million people gathered on the Plaza de Mayo to acclaim the new President.  One of C\u00e1mpora's first presidential actions was a granting of amnesty to political prisoners who where jailed during the dictatorship.  On 28 May Argentina restored diplomatic relations with Cuba, which then received Argentine aid - such as food and industrial products - to break the United States embargo against Cuba.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6AXjZOza0COFkKKv0Qqn5LQx19L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "iMdQPZ-RcIs"}
