The stage was blessed, and Carlos burned it up. Roots reggae with passion and strength was his gift to the people this evening. Carlos was exciting and inspirational, while his band kept a steady 'riddim'. Live shows are a true window to a performers heart, and this show is no exception!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
