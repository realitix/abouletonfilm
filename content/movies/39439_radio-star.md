After his only hit song 'The Rain and You', he became involved in drug problems, mob fights, and now sings in a caf\u00e9 in the countryside. He one day gets into a fight with one of the customers at the caf\u00e9, and needs bail money to get released from a lockup. Desperately trying to free him, his manager PARK Min-soo comes up with the solution to send CHOI Gon to a radio station in a far, remote town in the suburbs as a DJ, so that the radio station can pay for the bail.
