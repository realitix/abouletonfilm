When struggling singer Audrey and wealthy record executive Julia collide at the mall, they wake up in each other\u2019s lives the next morning. Audrey finds that, though Julia\u2019s life is full of luxury, she\u2019s missing the chance to connect with her family in any real way while Julia finds that, though she gets plenty of family time, Audrey can\u2019t say no to anyone giving her no time for herself. As Christmas looms closer, the two women rush to figure out how to both help each other and switch back before they miss Christmas morning with their own families!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w8ag4lvcx4PcBr9QQLXDArsFpsX.jpg", "actors": ["Jackie Seiden (Audrey Turner)", "Ashley Wood (Julia Samson)", "Houston Rhines (Paul Turner)", "John Patrick Jordan (Alex Samson)", "Oana Gregory (Laurel Samson)", "Cleary Herzlinger (Kelly Turner)", "Annie Abbott (Mrs. Nick)", "Lou Beatty Jr. (Stan)", "Brendan Robinson (Tyler)", "Taj Speights (Gavin Vaughn)", "Joey Ruggiero (Colton)", "Doris L.
