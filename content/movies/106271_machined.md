For Motor Man Dan, the ultimate would be to have his very own serial killer, to fulfill his sick, obsessive, murderous appetite. Ryan, the victim of a terrible accident who suffered severe head trauma, would be that missing piece to complete Motor Man's demented collection. Motor Man would then tool and manufacture a half machine, half man, serial killer, which he would then orchestrate and produce an assortment of killing scenarios. From director Craig McMahon comes this gruesome/slasher tale of a desolate man that took collecting serious.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gn6yMLzKHAqQVwBsRQQvIGDinqs.jpg", "actors": ["David C.
