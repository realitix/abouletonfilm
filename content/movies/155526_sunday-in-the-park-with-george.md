While the painting depicts people gathered on an island in the Seine, the musical goes beyond simply describing their lives. It is an exploration of art, of love, of commitment. Seurat connected dots to create images; Lapine and Sondheim use connection as the heart of all our relationships. Winner of the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z2B0NWrPWcyl3FrRvwyoxtPuQJs.jpg", "actors": ["Mandy Patinkin (Georges Seurat / George)", "Bernadette Peters (Dot / Marie)", "Barbara Bryne (Old Lady / Blair Daniels)", "Dana Ivey (Yvonne / Naomi Eisen)", "Charles Kimbrough (Jules / Bob Greenberg)", "Mary D'Arcy (Celeste #2 / Elaine)", "Sue Anne Gershenson (Woman / Photographer)", "Cris Groenendaal (Louis / Billy Webster)", "John Jellison (Man with bicycle / Museum Assistant)", "Frank Kopyc (Mr. / Lee Randolph)", "Judith Moore (Nurse / Mrs. / Harriet Pawling)", "Nancy Opel (Frieda / Betty)", "William Parry (Boatman / Charles Redmond)", "Natalie Polizzi (Louise)", "Michele Rigan (Girl)", "Melanie Vaughan (Celeste #1 / Waitress)", "Robert Westenberg (Soldier / Alex)", "Brent Spiner (Franz / Dennis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [21073], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
