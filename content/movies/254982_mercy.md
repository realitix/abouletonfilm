Now plaintive, now crass, now searching, now pleading, the line takes on a haunting quality not quite undercut by the tune\u2019s tongue-in-cheek twang. The work introduced a recurring motif in the artist\u2019s repertoire: the slick-haired singer, a persona Kjartansson has honed in real life as front man for the synth-heavy Reykjav\u00edk rock band Trabant, now on hiatus. The band\u2019s performances \u2014 as seen on YouTube, anyway \u2014 have been blowout affairs, full of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll swagger and screaming teenage fans. Mercy was a first step toward connecting this sassy streak with the artist\u2019s maturing explorations of Icelandic identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xijFBUEUWWrw2vHWUWBi1Goowjf.jpg", "actors": ["Ragnar Kjartansson (Ragnar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
