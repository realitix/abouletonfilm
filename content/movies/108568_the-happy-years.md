He gets into one situation after another and incurs the dislike of his classmates, who think he is cowardly but he changes their opinion when he challenges several of them to a fight. When he returns home for the summer, he meets Miss Dolly Travers and increases his 'hatred of women' because she does not accept his schoolboy pranks. Back at school, in the fall, he is more difficult than ever until his philosophy is changed by a teacher.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g86d09l5VkA3vOe0vM5SspjfSJ5.jpg", "actors": ["Dean Stockwell (John Humperdink 'Dink' Stover)", "Darryl Hickman (George 'Tough' McCarty)", "Scotty Beckett ('Tennessee' Shad)", "Leon Ames (Sr. Samuel H.
