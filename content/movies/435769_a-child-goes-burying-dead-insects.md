With each repetition, the film images are broken down and the color is fading. The girl is performed by the filmmaker herself, channeling media as a medium. This film is structural but also has a narrative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jdg7aoj6dvcVG9SNtLm8kzuYtiy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
