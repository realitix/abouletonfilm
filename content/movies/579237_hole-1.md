These striking studs are deprived of sunlight and any regular comforts, but they are given one simple luxury: another man to feed their voracious desires. The directors of this two-part feature, Tony Dimarco and Adam Killian, create a rough, run-down institutional world, and they fill the 'Hole' with hung studs and hot bottoms. Every action is caught by closed-circuit monitors that are pumped into every cell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ahDtSGbdnAQjzDC1JgZwG5vVIOX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
