It is May, 2005 in Central Arnhem Land: 'We are making a movie. The story is their story, those that live on this land, in their language, and set a long time before the coming of the Balanda, as we white people are known. For the people of the Arafura Swamp, this film is an opportunity, maybe a last chance to hold on to the old ways. For all of us, the challenges are unexpected, the task beyond anything imagined. For me, it is the most difficult film I have made, in the most foreign land I've been to...and it is Australia.' - Rolf de Heer", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fL3JZIjYzEy8Iye5rXZ6CpQP9iE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
