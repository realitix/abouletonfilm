Featuring Joel Salatin, Chuck Wirtz, Fred Kirschenmann, Steve Ells, Paul Willis, and farmers across America, it takes an even-handed look at animal husbandry. First explaining how America arrived at our current industrial system, the story shifts to the present day, showing the feedlots and confinement houses, not through hidden cameras but through the eyes of the farmers who live and work there. From there, the documentary introduces the revolution taking root in animal husbandry, led by the charismatic and passionate Joel Salatin. Stories are shared of farmers across the country who have changed their life to start grass-based farms, and everyday solutions highlight actions people can make to support America's agriculture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8ndizogAZke45rYncvKPEBzuY3e.jpg", "actors": ["Joel Salatin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "knNLZvphhfs"}
