This curious and curiously entertaining story involves one Jonathan Xavier and his devoted misfit gang who, incidentally, have been exiled to Earth from the far reaches of outer space. Johnny's former girlfriend Bliss has left him and stolen his Resurrection Suit, a cosmic, mind-bending uniform that gives the owner power over others. Along the way, there will be several highly stylized musical numbers, lots of genuinely humorous dialogue, and a wacky plot-twist or two, all beautifully captured on the very last of Kodak's black-and-white Plus-X film stock.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x5f1DNKwid7Pce9afAQd2waPtDs.jpg", "actors": ["Will Keenan (Johnny X)", "Creed Bratton (Mickey O'Flynn)", "De Anna Joy Brooks (Bliss)", "Reggie Bannister (King Clayton)", "Jed Rowen (Sluggo)", "Kate Maberly (Dandi Conners)", "Paul Williams (Cousin Quilty)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [247308, 84391, 365083, 103071], "youtube_key": "umH1IhuWchY"}
