The final moments of the final game have become one of the most controversial events in Olympic history. With play tied, the score table horn sounded during a second free throw attempt that put the U.S. ahead by one. But the Soviets claimed they had called for a time out before the basket and confusion ensued. The clock was set back by three seconds twice in a row and the Russians finally prevailed at the very last. The U.S. protested, but a jury decided in the USSR\u2019s favor and Team USA voted unanimously to refuse its silver medals. The Soviet players have been treated as heroes at home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g7dr7pC2JYOBi3heCudlI5Ec5jY.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Mashkov ()", "Ivan Kolesnikov ()", "Viktoriya Tolstoganova ()", "Marat Basharov ()", "Andrey Smolyakov ()", "Sergey Garmash ()", "John Savage ()", "Andrius Paulavi\u010dius (Jonas)", "Alexandra Revenko ()", "Jay Bowdy ()", "Oliver Morton ()", "James Tratas ()", "Chidi Ajufo ()", "Kirill Zaytsev ()", "Lacy Diamond ()", "Isaiah Jarel ()", "Kibwe Trim ()", "Kuzma Saprykin (Ivan Yedeshko)", "Natalya Kurdyubova (sports commentator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [497722, 497713, 440630, 468988], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
