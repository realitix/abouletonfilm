Setting out as a free collective in the early 70ies, soon the social experiment emerged as a totalitarian system, which, 20 years later, ended in a dramatic failure. Through the eyes of these children, the film looks back at the community and examines what has become of the children of this utopia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/brUwUfOEPwwKcDuHXSUYyjvJb5c.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Schlothauer ()", "Nico Aimar ()", "Otto Muehl ()", "Patricia Dubois ()", "Attila Muehl ()", "Andy Simanowitz ()", "Wencke M\u00fchleisen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
