{"tmdb_id": 204491, "title": "Tory Boy", "original_title": "Tory Boy", "slug_title": "tory-boy", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "7.0/10", "synopsis": "Against all the odds, film-maker and Labour voter John Walsh becomes a Conservative Candidate for a seat in a Labour heartland during the British 2010 General Election Campaign. What he uncovers is a place where intimidation and neglect have scarred a town that politics has forgotten. He goes on a quest to find the local absentee Labour Member of Parliament. Using his insights as a candidate and animation techniques, ToryBoy is a political satire that cuts to the heart of the current British anger over politicians who have exploited a system for years. Working with news footage, animation and film from the campaign shot over six months, ToryBoy is a unique insight into the political culture of one of the worlds oldest democracies.
