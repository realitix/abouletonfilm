The family (mum, dad, girl and boy) are displaced persons from Northern and Eastern Europe. Produced for the Department of Immigration during the migrant boom that followed World War Two, the film's essential message is \"We want them. We need them\". It presents an idealised Australia, \"a happy, smiling land\" where people are generally friendly and accepting despite some xenophobia, and echoes the government policies of decentralisation and assimilation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sjeTP8CCPmV0m0VkH9mgRKKhPp1.jpg", "actors": ["John Fernside ()", "Eric Reiman ()", "Ailita Blaumanis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
