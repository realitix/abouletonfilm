The Phone Confession Line is based on anonymous callers ringing to confess on things they had done or thought like adultery, theft, murder or regrets. Thereafter anybody could call and listen to the confessions. Although making a confession was free, listening to a confession costs money. After Cohen got his hands on the confessions, he used them as an audio heartbeat to accompany video-images of every day life in New York City he had taken over the years. This installation is a portrait of the city with its dark secrets, hushed voices and nocturnal images. In this way Cohen tries to bring across an experience to the viewer that relies on absence, waiting and the effort to hear something in the dark.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8coSvrxkKmUOn8sno2fOKVr4uSl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
