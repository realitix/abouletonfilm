His subversive, innovative works are taking Europe by storm. But his own body is failing him. Dave is 34 and has cystic fibrosis. The average life expectancy for sufferers is 37. His doctors have given him two years to live unless he has a lung transplant. With the sense of urgency growing, his best friend and creative partner, director and actress Brigitte Poupart, turns her camera on the daily life of a man who is waiting for a life-or-death call from the doctor. A call that could come at any moment. United by art and friendship, the two create a space in which creativity emerges as a vital act. Over My Dead Body is an engrossing private diary that accepts neither taboos nor fate. It features testimonials from Dave's friends, loved ones and collaborators, as well as excerpts from his works.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ugz35nZT9C0xIv4OlXktUQSx9M.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Saint-Pierre ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
