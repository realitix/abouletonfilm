The biggest project of its type in the history of Calgary, Wreck City invited over 150 artists to participate. Operating on good faith, a shoestring budget, and naive energy, a curatorial collective facilitated the project, negotiated by-law, police complaints, graffiti, and accusations of aiding and abetting gentrification.  Created in a month and open to the public for just over a week, artists crafted accessible works of public art dealing with a vast number of issues and themes, including gentrification, community, and the institutionalized art world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
