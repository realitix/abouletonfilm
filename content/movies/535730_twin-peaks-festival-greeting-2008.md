It only screened once and is in Black and white. In this film, Lynch is speaking backwards in what looks to be a cross between the floors of Eraserhead and the Twin Peaks Red Room. Sitting next to him is a plastic doll with the face of Laura Palmer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9L8wdLlRU3A2pC3b2OwiFmUVkhe.jpg", "actors": ["David Lynch (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
