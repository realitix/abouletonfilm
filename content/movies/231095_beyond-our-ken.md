Despite preparing to fight yet another court case Ken Dyers and Jan Hamilton allow a film crew unprecedented access to the 'spiritual evolvement centre' they founded in 1982. How can the view from inside Kenja be so different to the one outside? Through remarkable verite footage and candid interviews, Beyond Our Ken explores the anatomy and ambiguity of the 'cult' enigma.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rML5Or7e4P9dzhThdFDeqCXtioy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
