In the film a farmer's young son, sent to town to hire a man for the harvest, readily accepts when an itinerant trumpet player, down on his luck, begs a chance. He is hardly the kind of man the boy's father had in mind, but that night his trumpet speaks from the shadows and everyone pauses to listen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y9K4w4Jrj469bppWC4VDZUvnQjM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
