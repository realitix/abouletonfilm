Bond has always been silly and, sadly, the 2006 reboot has thrown it all away and has no rewatchbility."}, {"pseudo": "Wuchak", "content": "Not as good as the previous four, but still a solid Bond film with Christopher Walken, Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones\r\n\r\nA mission in wintery Siberia leads Agent 007 (Roger Moore) to globetrot from England to Paris to San Francisco and Silicon Valley investigating a horse-racing scam and the psychopathic entrepreneur, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), who schemes to flood Silicon Valley for the purpose of creating a global microchip monopoly.\r\n\r\nThis was Moore\u2019s last of 7 Bond films from 1973-1985 and it\u2019s a solid Bond flick, just not up to the exceptionalness of the previous four films: \u201cThe Spy Who Loved Me\u201d (1977), \u201cMoonraker\u201d (1979), \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d (1981) and \u201cOctopussy\u201d (1983). Just as \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d toned down the excesses of \u201cMoonraker,\u201d so \u201cA View to a Kill\u201d (1985) scales things down after the ultra-action-packed adventures of \u201cOctopussy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs such, the movie focuses a little more on the psychological drama of intrigue and rivalry. For instance, there\u2019s a long sequence at Zorin\u2019s impressive chateau and a horse racing scene that\u2019s reminiscent of the low-key golf game in \u201cGoldfinger\u201d (1964). Despite this direction, there\u2019s still a lot of action, like a thrilling ski chase in Siberia, a murder/chase at the Eiffel Tower & Paris, a brouhaha at a mansion, a fiery elevator shaft episode, a wild vehicle chase through the streets of San Francisco with a fire engine, an extended clash in Zorin\u2019s mine complex near the San Andreas fault and a thrilling climax at the Golden Gate Bridge.\r\n\r\nOn the female front, Tanya Roberts is just stunning and has a couple of quality scenes. A year earlier she did \"Sheena\" where she had to thin down to fit into a skimpy animal-skin bikini (although she still looked great). Meanwhile Grace Jones is a formidable villainous with an interesting story arc. Mary Ann Catrin Stavin also has a quality cameo in the opening teaser.\r\n\r\nI shouldn\u2019t close without mentioning critics\u2019 denouncements of Zorin\u2019s psychopathic actions in the mines. I don\u2019t get these whiney criticisms, are Bond villains supposed to be nice guys or something? Zorin is mad and this is what megalomaniacal whack jobs do!\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [699, 700, 691, 708], "youtube_key": "cLM6QjHEOIU"}
