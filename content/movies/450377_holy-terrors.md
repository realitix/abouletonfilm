{"tmdb_id": 450377, "title": "Holy Terrors", "original_title": "Holy Terrors", "slug_title": "holy-terrors", "date": "2017-07-14", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "8.0/10", "synopsis": "The Welsh writer Arthur Machen wrote many acclaimed stories of the supernatural which brought him great fame in the 1920s. His work has faded from view in the decades since leaving just a dedicated following including Stephen King and Mick Jagger. Holy Terrors is a new film aiming to bring Machen to a new audience and adapts six of his tales into a spine-tingling portmanteau film. Effectively capturing the unique atmosphere and feel of Machen\u2019s writing, Holy Terrors is sure to provide a night or two of uneasy sleep for the viewer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4JCecPUbS4ZzlX3VMqxqeloZScr.jpg", "actors": ["Timothy Greenwood ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
