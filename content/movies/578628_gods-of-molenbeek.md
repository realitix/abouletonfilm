Here, they listen to spiders, discover black holes, and fight about what is going to steer a flying carpet. Together they search for the answers to life's big questions. But the brutality of the adult world makes itself known when terrorists detonate a bomb in the neighborhood. Aaatos envies Amine's Muslim faith and looks for his own gods, although his classmate Flo questions him; she is strongly convinced that anyone who believes in God is completely nuts. Gods of Molenbeek is a wonderful portrayal of childhood friendship, inquiry and the creation of meaning in a chaotic time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4QFwXz04kVeaQc3M8Z1E22vPmNu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3h2L6mvEI1o"}
