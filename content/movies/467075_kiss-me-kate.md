When the egotistical Fred Graham mounts a musical adaptation of The Taming of The Shrew (with himself as director, producer, and star) he\u2019s got the perfect leading lady in mind: his movie star ex-wife! The fireworks both onstage and off between the two seem destined to explode the entire production\u2026or will a romantic flame that\u2019s Too Darn Hot be rekindled?  With backstage shenanigans, gangsters brushing up their Shakespeare, and a collection of Porter tunes that any Tom, Dick, or Harry will love, Kiss Me, Kate remains an all-time favorite of musical fans from Padua to Peoria.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rwizsnSV18Z18TaIzDeghOMKoQw.jpg", "actors": ["Brent Barrett (Fred Graham / Petruchio)", "Rachel York (Lilli Vanessi / Katherine)", "Michael Berresse (Bill Calhoun / Lucentio)", "Nolan Frederick (Paul)", "Nicholas Colicos (Harrison Howell)", "Kaye Brown (Hattie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
