George Clinton, Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins and the rest of the P-Funk collective were riding the success of their first Top 5 R&amp;B hit, \"Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker),\" a track that had earned them the kind of radio play that would bring the masses out to see them live in a stadium-sized arena. The group was only five dates into the tour when they arrived in Houston, but they were definitely ready to take it to the stage for an out-of-this-world show like no other. Taped on October 31, 1976, these seldom-seen performances at the Houston Summit represent Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic in their '70s prime, in the era of their Mothership Connection and The Clones Of Dr. Funkenstein LPs--a rare opportunity for everyone to get their proper dose of The P-Funk.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/imfgIhcmwqEoyZ651EqROODff16.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
