Like some of the other flicks Wong had his name on (Eighth Happiness, All's Well Ends Well), In-Laws, Out-Laws centers on family hijinks, and is generally steeped in cultural mores which may lose some Western audiences. However, unlike those films, In-Laws, Out-Laws has extra source material: it was based on a hit Guangzhou television show, which means an extra layer of cultural specificity which might make the film even more inaccessible to Western audiences. Another major difference: most of the cast members of this film are generally not \"names\" in the Hong Kong entertainment circle. Also, the movie is really not very good, though that's not really a function of the above-named differences. It's just the way things are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/phC50pfLzsfXPnROtrhPf2vB1O7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
