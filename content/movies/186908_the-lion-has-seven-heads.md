A white-robed preacher wanders and sermonizes across African lands (in a stream-of-consciousness performance by L\u00e9aud); European communists and CIA spies conspire out of mutual self interest to engineer the appointment of an African bourgeois to a puppet government presidency; and a revolutionary group marches in exile. Rocha\u2019s second feature film after fleeing Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, Der Leone Have Sept Cabe\u00e7as introduces intentionally disorienting new situations in virtually every scene, the result of a largely improvised production that cast European actors, local villagers, and real guerilleros side-by-side.  - MoMA", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rYsNQnLQZHj7SdluaDV6ckrcpqq.jpg", "actors": ["Rada Rassimov (Marlene)", "Giulio Brogi (Pablo)", "Gabriele Tinti (American Agent)", "Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud (Preacher)", "Aldo Bixio (Mercenary)", "Baiack (Zumbi)", "Reinhard Kolldehoff (Governor)", "Hugo Carvana (Portugu\u00eas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XeAwMIPSJls"}
