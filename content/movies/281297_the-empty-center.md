The effect of the changing economy and politics on the city and its inhabitants is echoed through their physical relocation to its outer edges. In 1990, squatters proclaim a socialist republic on the death strip. Eight years later, the new headquarters of Mercedes Benz are built in the same location. The film makes use of slow super-impositions to uncover a journey across changing architectural and cultural boundaries. \"The Empty Centre\" tries to give a voice and a history to those who continue to be marginalised by the simultaneous dismantling and reconstruction of the borders which they are trying to cross.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c3CCI84RRWL0qAEHuexsda9VJc3.jpg", "actors": ["Dong Yang ()", "Huan Zhu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
