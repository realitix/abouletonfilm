She and her lifelong friend Ana are two of the toughest members of their gang, fearing nothing but the loss of each other. Car-jacking, fights, and running from the cops are a daily routine as the girls fight to protect their territory and their reputation. Performing as \"Outrageous Chaos\" in local dance contests provides their only relief, but each night they must return home to the sad reality of their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aMGepGHrwNhnHII8FGSMm5cGggN.jpg", "actors": ["Katrina Gibson (Kata)", "Jay Hernandez (Kikicho)", "Melida Prado (Ana)", "Yvette Cruise (Rosa)", "Angela Alvarado (Pilar)", "J.D.
