We follow fragments of the lives of young girls from a social institution for children and young adults without parents. In the first story, a wealthy young couple wants to adopt a five-year-old girl, Zeljka. The emotionally undeveloped child has a hard time adapting to her new environment. In Ferije, fifteen-year-old Visnja spends her winter holidays in a gloomy home for young delinquents, where she experiences her first romance. The heroine of the third story is nineteen-year-old Branka who, after her graduation, tries to find a job and become independent from the social institutions she has lived in her entire life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xeCPryeOBwmVY0PUrMHj7jiEWkE.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Buzancic ()", "Vanja Drach ()", "Marija Fabris ()", "Tatjana Ivko ()", "Sanda Langerholz ()", "Lela Margiti\u0107 ()", "Marina Nemet ()", "Rajka Ru\u0161an ()", "Slavko \u0160timac ()", "Zvonimir Torjanac ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
