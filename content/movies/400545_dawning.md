What the siblings don't know is that a creature has been wreaking havoc on the local wildlife and farm animals, creating a volatile situation for all parties involved. When their parents do not come home after their first night in the cabin, Chris and Aurora's minds begin to break down and tension builds. As the night draws nearer and unseen responsibilities mount, hope becomes harder and harder to come by...if only they can hold out until the dawn. Shot in the style of an observational documentary, slowly morphs into a gritty, stylized suspense picture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fI1RfBibkpTxY6zPSNMSvdV1AXW.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Cram (Chris Benton)", "Matthew Feeney (Hunter)", "Bill Gorman (John Halstead)", "Zach Hammill (Mike)", "Ellie Johnson (Sarah)", "Michael Dennis Johnson (Jerry Halstead)", "Ty Mabley (Richard Benton)", "Alisa Mattson (Denise)", "Elaine Thompson (Laura Benton)", "Ryan Wotherspoon (Derek)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
