The successes (without any rewards) were largely due to their French imports, Henry, Viera, Pires and Wiltord - all of whom were outstanding. Includes interviews with manager Wenger and veterans Dixon, Seaman and Adams as well as Henry and rising England star Ashley Cole.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ibL5sVHZx8Q441fiJ2xqKGT7EA8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
