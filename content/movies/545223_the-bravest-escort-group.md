En route, they must fend off the attacks of enemy general Hala (Chen Zhi Hui), as well as Ma Bao\u2019s treacherous second-in-command Ma Biao (Shi Yanneng), all the while being closely watched by the mysterious Zhu You (Andrew Lin). Though Wu Sangui and Chen Yuanyuan are real historical figures, the film plays fast, furious and loose with history, and presents itself like a late little brother to Teddy Chen\u2019s Bodyguards and Assassins, on a wider geographical scale but \u2013 obviously \u2013 smaller spectacular scale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/475nlAW0dIdelleel0sAw6aPmOu.jpg", "actors": ["Fan Siu-Wong (\u6768\u516d\u5b89)", "Che Yongli (\u963f\u6735)", "\u91ca\u5f66\u80fd (\u9a6c\u5f6a)", "\u65bd\u5357 (\u9648\u5706\u5706)", "Ray Lui (\u9a6c\u5b9d)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "d4bI_phyP58"}
