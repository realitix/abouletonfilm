His wife and daughter Anna receive the guests who are invited to the feast, with a dish of pike as the main course.  But suddenly, the celebration turns sour at the appearance of an unexpected guest - namely Oberholzer's brother Alois, the black sheep of the family, who disappeared years ago. As it turns out, Alois has since changed his name to \"Obolski\" and become ringmaster of a major circus. Him and his wife Iduna quickly threaten the morals and standards of the bourgeois party, and they proceed to turn the boring proceedings into a turbulent circus show. Fortunately, after much confusion, the story ends happily - altough the pike has burned black in the oven!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/awv23rQMOh3N4VHEyygRD24QVep.jpg", "actors": ["Ruedi Walter (Gustav Oberholzer)", "Margrit Rainer (Kattri, die K\u00f6chin)", "Inigo Gallo (Alois Obolski)", "J\u00f6rg Schneider (Fritz Oberholzer)", "Ines Torelli (Iduna Obolski)", "Max R\u00f6thlisberger (Albert Oberholzer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
