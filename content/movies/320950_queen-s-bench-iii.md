Besides writing, directing, and producing, the talented Alfred Cheung also starred in the courtroom drama as Chang, an aspiring young lawyer who takes on the tricky case of defending for Fai (Tony Leung), a man charged with murdering a girl in the woods. Chang believes that Fai is innocent, but can he save the man and nail the real culprit with the treacherous prosecutor Fang (screen villain Sunny Fang Kang) on the opposing side? Luckily, Chang gets some help from Carrie Ng as a fellow lawyer, Carina Lau as Fai's girlfriend and a witness, and Dodo who makes a cameo appearance as Chang's aunt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3gBGk4HwabKyzfb30wTFpZPfzLS.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Leung Ka-Fai (Chen Tsu-Hui)", "Carina Lau (Ms Chen)", "Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (Lawyer Chang)", "Carrie Ng (Lawyer Wu)", "Sunny Fang Kang (Prosecutor James Fang)", "Carol Cheng (Chang's aunt)", "Terrence Fok (Li Fan-Kan)", "Wai Ching (Kan's father)", "Lau Chin-Dai (Lin Chen-Chen)", "Chan Yau-Hau ()", "Lui Tat (Uncle Lei)", "Foo Wang-Tat (Judge)", "Ku Ming-Wah (Fang's assistant)", "Raymond Yip Wai-Man ()", "Chan Wing-Chiu ()", "Cheung Wing-Cheung (Policeman)", "Shui Yin (Li Hsiao-Lien)", "Chu Hak (Judge C.
