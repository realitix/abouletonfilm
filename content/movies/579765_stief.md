The artifice of certain compositions of images is opposed to the botanical naturalism of other compositions, and makes the tension between the different compositional and photographic approaches becomes a new challenge. The film includes several chapters or stanzas that differ in their rhythms, dominant colors and emotions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/24WGfPvyiMDpzI6HJF0C4tq8tHv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
