They accidentally witness the assassination of the scrawny punk kingpin of local heavies The Chains. No sooner does his ventilated blond spiked noggin hit the concrete than The Chains are up in arms and looking for any possible suspects. As the yuppies try to peel out to safety, a frenzied youth (played by a frenzied 35-year-old) spazzes his way into their unlocked back door with a resounding \"Get me the fuck outta here!\" It turns out the new passenger is indeed the hunted gunman, though he was only avenging the murder of his baby brother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uLX4Io2xTNoegUBmZAybBOcOmZd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
