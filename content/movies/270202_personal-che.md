Different people around the globe reinterpret the legend of Che Guevara at will: from the rebel living in Hong Kong fighting Chinese domination, to the German neonazi preaching revolution and the Castro-hating Cuban. Their testimonies prove that the Argentinian revolutionary's historical impact reverberates still. But like with all legends, each sees what he will, in often contradictory perspectives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nHqdCII3GA8wj8i1cNJx6lKEvCp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
