Based on Offenbach's meatier second version (1874) of the Orpheus legend, it features nicely judged performances across the board and some stunning special effects, notably the explosive locomotive crash signalling the breach of the divide between Heaven and Hell. Satire reigns, not least in the reactionary figure of Public Opinion, a pinny-clad bossy boots with a hint of Dame Edna Everage about her. Olympus is a moribund salon full of bored Gods, sick of the Ambrosian diet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uw7QzeoWi5VpUoAmjiU2Wkq7AN4.jpg", "actors": ["Alexandru Badea (Orpheus)", "Elizabeth Vidal (Eurydice)", "Dale Duesing (Jupiter)", "Reinaldo Macias (Astr\u00e9e-Pluton)", "Franck Cassard (Mercury)", "Marie-No\u00eblle de Callata\u00ff (Cupidon)", "Andr\u00e9 Jung (John Styx)", "Desir\u00e9e Meiser (L'Opinion Publique)", "Laurence Misonne (Minerve)", "Michele Patzakis (Venus)", "Sonja Theodoridou (Diane)", "Jacqueline van Quaille (Juno)", "Franck Cassard (Mercure)", "Patrick Davin (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
