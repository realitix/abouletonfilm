Lucky for him, his lost demo tape is recovered by an American producer who likes what he hears \u2026 and Dad may eventually come around. Steve Marriott (who would later join The Small Faces and Humble Pie) makes an early appearance in this musical romp, also known by the title Live It Up.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
