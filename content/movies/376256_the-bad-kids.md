On any given day, principal Vonda Viland calls kids at the crack of dawn to see if they\u2019ll make it to school. And if they need a ride? Well, she\u2019ll pick them up. Vonda knows each student\u2019s challenges and coaches them tirelessly, never fostering false hopes. Her philosophy combines loving compassion with realism, and given her school\u2019s rising graduation rate, it seems to be working.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u06QPcJJOp3CS80kOKgXNpfuk2d.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Buruma (Himself)", "Cai Guo-Qiang (Himself)", "Wen-You Cai (Herself)", "Wenhao Cai (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [14344, 419303, 454349, 401278], "youtube_key": "-gHRZKRuuRk"}
