At first, Kei and Yuri refused to work with each other, and Kei even resigned from the 3WA. Afterwards, the two continued to work together, although they earned their nickname, \"the Dirty Pair\" because of all the collateral damage the two (unintentionally) cause in the completion of their cases. And even though the two now get along with one another, they continue to bicker and complain to each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/79SChyHDVkoRWz33QopDsLfwM0v.jpg", "actors": ["Rica Matsumoto (Kei (Voice))", "Mariko Kouda (Yuri (Voice))", "Phil Ross (Chief Garner (Voice) English)", "Hajime Koseki (Chief Garner (Voice))", "Yumi Touma (Iris (Voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
