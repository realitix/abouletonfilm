Her widowed dad, Bhushan, and his widowed mother both approve and they formally get engaged. Bhushan passes away suddenly and Chandni is unable to get married as there is no one to look after her much younger siblings, Anuj and Sandhya, and as a result the wedding gets postponed. She struggles to maintain the family by teaching music and continues to stay in touch with Prem. 12 years later, Anuj gets married to Natasha, and Chandni hopes to wed Prem, but things do terribly wrong when Natasha humiliates Prem and then decides to move out.
