More redneck jokes than you can poke a rednecks retriever at from Jeff. Plenty of \"Here's your sign\" jokes from Bill. Sarcasm from Ron and Larry the cable guys backwards thinking. And like all the series with the four coming together at the end to basically tell jokes to make the others laugh. Highly recommended if you like crude jokes about the less fortunate and the not so smart."}], "recommandations_id": [22427, 31341, 45062, 25604], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
