The closer she gets to a resolution, the bigger it gets. The 7-year-old faces missing dinosaurs, the polka dot pox and more. Four episodes of the Noggin animated series are included, and each contains songs, stories and \"great big fancy words\" to teach kids vocabulary.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
