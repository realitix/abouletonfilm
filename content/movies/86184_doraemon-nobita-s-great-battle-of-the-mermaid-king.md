XD\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love this Doraemon movie so much!!! XD\r\n\r\nIt was in fact My favorite Mermaid Movie of all time!! :D\r\n\r\nI love Sophia, The Mermaid Princess of \"The Planet Aqua\", who ends up landing on Nobita's and Doraemon's backyard, thinking She's so cute and beautiful! XD\r\n\r\nIt always reminds me of Ariel from Disney's Little Mermaid (1989) and Ripjaws from Ben 10! XD\r\n\r\nSophia from Doraemon, according to the Japanese Wikipedia says that She might have been inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's The little Mermaid from Denmark in 1837.\r\n\r\nand she speaks \"Aquarian\", a native fictional language of Planet Aqua (In Japanese language websites only, of course.).\r\n\r\nSo, happy \"Mermaid\" day!! XD"}], "recommandations_id": [52795, 218726, 285812]}
