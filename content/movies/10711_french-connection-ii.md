William Friedkin's film was excellent - yet contained too many scenes of people sitting in cars watching other people go in and out of buildings - the stakeout scenes bring the film to a halt. The scenes were integral, yes, but they are a damn drag to sit through.\r\n\r\nFrankenheimer's _French Connection II_ is a superbly acted and taut thriller that contains a substantial amount of humour too! The perfect movie.\r\n\r\nHackman's finest performance can be found here and his harrowing withdrawal from heroin is a wonder to behold. \r\n\r\nYes, this is an action packed masterpiece and I thoroughly recommend it to fans of gritty 70's cinema."}], "recommandations_id": [1051, 26039, 11935, 16241]}
