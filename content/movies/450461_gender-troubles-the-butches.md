They are not going through a rebellious stage or imitating men. They are women who, while being true to their most authentic selves, look and behave in some ways that society has decided is appropriate only for males. While lesbians and gay men are enjoying more acceptance from society in general, this tolerance is often limited to those individuals who seem most like their heterosexual counterparts: feminine women and masculine men. The women in this film examine and challenge society's assumptions about gender roles and show the courage it takes to be true to oneself. Their struggles reveal how everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, is pressured to conform and measure up to restrictive gender standards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/luoFHWI0GV7566WeIcQ0LATthO8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
