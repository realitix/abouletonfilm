The recently formed Black American film group TNEG\u2122 has set out to elucidate this very question. Hearing from the likes of fine artist Kara Walker and musical artist Flying Lotus, the film is based on a deceptively simple approach -- asking a refined list of black 'specialists' as well as 'uncommon folks' questions about what they think, and more importantly as lead director Arthur Jafa states, 'What they KNOW' -- the film is an unprecedented 'stream of the black consciousness' and a strikingly original and rarefied look at black intellectual and emotional life. What's so unorthodox about this simple approach is that the interviews were recorded separately from the images in the film. What results is a breathtaking, kaleidoscopic look of American black life from the dawn of three original filmmakers.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charles Burnett ()", "Hortense Spillers ()", "Saidiya Hartman ()", "Kathleen Cleaver ()", "Fred Moten ()", "Flying Lotus ()", "Storyboard P.
