They talk about adolescence, bras, commercial images of women's figures, having implants or, in one case, a breast reduction, health problems with silicone, doctors' exams (\"I think you have a throat infection, let me examine your breasts\"), breasts as power tools and as objects of pleasure, cancer, living with mastectomies, and the effects of time and gravity. Two mother-daughter teams and two strippers participate. The women (and the girls) are humorous, straightforward, reflective, and good-natured about their bodies and their selves", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/epniROFbUshSIgU4WdI97KEX2RX.jpg", "actors": ["Susan Mason (Herself)", "Tawny Peaks (Herself)", "Rachel Rocketts (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
