In the war which ensued with the arrival of the military forces, Fr. Balweg was forced out of his parish and into the mountains, where he later became one of the most charismatic of leaders, admired by the masses, hated by the government and loved by many women.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTHqYrOfPki2cLmStCcLyymYMjj.jpg", "actors": ["Phillip Salvador ()", "Rio Locsin ()", "Johnny Delgado ()", "Tetchie Agbayani ()", "Pinky Amador ()", "Conrado Balweg ()", "Ernie David ()", "Mon Godiz ()", "Rene Hawkins ()", "Eddie Infante ()", "Baldo Marro ()", "Bebong Osorio ()", "Jose Romulo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
