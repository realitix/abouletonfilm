His findings suggested that the collective hordes of emotive Dianaphiles sobbing in the streets were not only encouraged but emulated by the media. In the aftermath of Diana's death a three-line whip was enforced on newspapers and on TV, selling the sainthood line wholesale. The suspicion was that journalists, like the public, greeted the death as a chance to wax emotional in print, as a change from the customary knowing cynicism, to wheel out all those portentous phrases they'd been saving up for the big occasion. Sadly, they just seemed to be showboating; the eulogies, laments and tear-soaked platitudes ringing risibly hollow.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Christopher Hitchens (Himself)", "Princess Diana (Herself (archive footage))", "Tony Blair (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
