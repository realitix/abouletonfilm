Williams found salvation by doing the one thing he loved most: hitting baseballs. In his rookie season with the Red Sox, where he would spend his entire career as a player, Williams batted .327, socked 31 homers and led the league with 145 RBI.  Over the next 21 years, despite losing five seasons of his prime to active service as a U.S. Marine Corps pilot, Williams hit 521 home runs, twice captured the Triple Crown, and became the oldest man ever to win a batting title. He finished his career with a .344 lifetime batting average, was the last man to hit over .400 in a full season, batting .406 in 1941, and was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c61J2CmnDVemAEDwyNTSpmKOng0.jpg", "actors": ["Claudia Williams (Herself)", "Robert Redford (Himself)", "Liev Schreiber (Narrator)", "Ted Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
