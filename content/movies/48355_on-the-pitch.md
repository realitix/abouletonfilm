He loves football so much that he even memorizes all the names of the members of the South Korean national team. One night during a search operation in which the leader and his troops chase a boar to satisfy their hunger, they come face to face with soldiers from South Korea. It doesn\u2019t take long for the soldiers to discover that they share a love of football and they begin secret radio communications so they can listen to matches together. When their secret is uncovered, the squad leader and his troops must find a way out of the situation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tvkAhiGvsGLw075ko5FbawAoisu.jpg", "actors": ["Jeong Kyung-ho  (Corporal Joo Geun-chi)", "Lee Seong-jae (Northern group first squad commande)", "Choi Ji-hyeon (Female police of radio team)", "Yoo Tae-woong (Northern investigative general)", "Choo Sang-rok (Northern group second squad commander)", "Lee Jeong-ho-I (Sentinel Mo Reum-jik)", "Ji Dae-han (Northern group platoon commande)", "Lee Seon-ho (Northern soldier)", "kim Dam-hee (Northern traveling troop)", "Heo Joong-hyeok (Sentinel Kang Ha-gyoo)", "Choi Sang-hak (Warrior Park Si-hak)", "Lee Jeong-joon (Warrior Ri Doo-ik)", "Yoo Min-hyeok (Sentinel Rim Dae-cheol)", "Park Ji-hoon (Northern group third squad commander)", "Lee Dal-Hyeong (Special duty sergeant)", "Kim Nan-joo (Traveling troop 1)", "Yoo Ga-yeong (Traveling troop 2)", "Sim-wan (Military police in radio team 1)", "Oh Seong-tae (Northern search party 3)", "Lee Soo-ho (Military police in radio team 2)", "Park Yong-Soo (Division commander)", "Lee Jeong-hyeon-I (Male armorer)", "Yoon Da-kyung (Female armorer)", "Yoo Dong-gyoon (Northern search party 1)", "Choi Si-chan (Northern search party 2)", "Jeong Jae-hoon (Northern search party 4)", "Moon Geon (Northern search party 5)", "Yoon Se-min (Northern search party 6)", "Park Jae-hoon (Northern search party 7)", "Lee Jong-hwan (Northern search party 8)", "Yoo Jeong-ho (Northern search party 9)", "Kim Yeong-yong (Guard 1)", "Kim Se-kyeong (Guard 2)", "Kim Won-beom (Caster)", "Son Yoon-sang (Commentator)", "Seo Gil-ja (Female soldier with meals)", "Kim You-jung (Radio female soldier)", "Kim Byung-chul (Staff sergeant Kang)", "Kang Seong-jin (Soldier Kim Eung-tae)", "Oh Tae-kyung (Soldier Ahn Gye-soo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
