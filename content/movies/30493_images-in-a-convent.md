Crazed with lust and desire many of the nuns pleasure themselves and each other in fear of the Mother Superior. One night a wounded man is found on the grounds of the convent and is brought inside to be healed. He becomes the focus of the young nuns' desires as each one tries to visit this young man. But along with him has come the evil force of Satan. A local priest proceeds to exorcise the demon from within the holy building driving the nuns into a delirium of sexual madness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9l6Qqbj7qMCRURQxyuD2uiWFl6Z.jpg", "actors": ["Paola Senatore (Isabella)", "Paola Maiolini (Sister Consolata)", "Marina Hedman (Sister Marta)", "Donald O'Brien (Exorcist)", "Brunello Chiodetti (Don Ascanio)", "Maria Rosaria Riuzzi (Sister Giulia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [125602], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
