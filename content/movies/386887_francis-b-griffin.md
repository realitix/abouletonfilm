And my secret of long life is to relax, all the time. So I don't get excited about things. If I want to say, do a job on a car, I do the job first, mess of it, then I get the manual out and see where its gone wrong. To put it broadly I'm a codger. Codgers a good word for it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iEUbgdejuPQwGuP6WiVTpCbSZVn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
