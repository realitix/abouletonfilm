The emotional scenes have been well enacted by **Shurti Hassan** esp in the climax when she cries her heart you.If you follow her journey carefully you will understand her pain.\r\n\r\n**Dhanush** as a school kid is not so convincing but in the second half he plays his a game. what a performer. Take a bow. He is unpredictable makes you shift at the edge of seat.\r\n\r\nWatch it for amazing storyline, screenplay and outstanding performances of lead cast.
