Their world was the streets, set against a backdrop of uprooted families, cultural alienation, drugs and violence. Neighborhood teenagers responded by organizing into street groups known to the members as \"families\", but labeled in the most alarming terms as violent gangs by the press. The documentation of these lives over a twenty-year period offers a remarkable perspective on life in the ghetto (spanning four generations), and the means that people devise to cope from the time that they are children to when they serve as parents and role models for a new generation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dEGO7OioN0SCuD83SIBhwzR1sBi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
