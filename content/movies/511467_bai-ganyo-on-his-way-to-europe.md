He personifies arrogance, insolence, greediness, and the absolute incapability to adopt any civilization principles of relationships. This protagonist was featured by great Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov in the end of 19 c., both with an incredible sense of humor and anguish. Whether being in the Wiener Opera, or visiting a famous scientist at his home, or shopping, or just walking down the streets, this Bulgarian character, Bay Ganyo, is no more than a hopeless barbarian. The film makes new interpretation of this classical literature work. The comic adventures of Baj Ganjo are reconstructed in retro-nostalgic tonality. The final episode when the protagonist appears on the stage of the Wiener Opera among the singers participating in a Mozart's opera is the culmination of the transition of the farce into a tragic comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fM74zgFb7b7T9wm9EXSLnWUB4dP.jpg", "actors": ["Georgi Kaloyanchev (\u0411\u0430\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u043d\u044c\u043e)", "Stoyan Aleksiev (\u0429\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0446\u0430)", "Filip Trifonov (\u0411\u043e\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0432)", "\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d \u0421\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432 (\u0418\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043a)", "Leda Taseva (\u0421\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0418\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043a)", "Ginka Stancheva ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
