One works as a secretary, one is a prostitute, and one is a criminal. The secretary is cynically unhappy with the sexist business world which limits her opportunities for advancement and makes her a target for her lecherous boss. The prostitute lives an aimless life, drifting between men, and often the target of either police or jealous wives. The criminal, who lives by disrupting the society which oppresses her two sisters, is the only happy one of the three.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1x09Y4kwxr1o4RtPsyT8sVCln0D.jpg", "actors": ["Akemi Nijo (Satsuki \u014ctsuki)", "Keiko Tsuzuki (Shinobu \u014ctsuki)", "Senro S\u014d (Sumire \u014ctsuki)", "Chigusa Takayama (Fujie \u014ctsuki)", "Kiyoko \u014ctani (Miyo Sawaki)", "Mako Mizuki (Y\u014dko Ikuta)", "Nobutaka Masutomi (Honda Rokur\u014d)", "Kenji Shimamura (Denkichi \u014ctsuki)", "Hiroyuki Mikawa (Ichir\u014d Sawaki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
