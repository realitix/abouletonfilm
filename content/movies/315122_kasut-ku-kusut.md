The storyline for \"Kasut Ku Kusut\" is easy for the audience's minds to digest. However, the often used word \"Bapok\" might not sit well with most audience. The characters that shine most in the film is no doubt the ones played by Shaheizy Sam and Along Eyzendy. The comedic characters that they play: Village youngsters, who speak with a heavy Perak accent, will no doubt tickle the audience's funny bones. The character played by Kamarool Haji Yusoff is just as impressive as he is seldom seen taking on a comedic part. The film about a 'messy' shoe affair turns messier with the chase scene - all because of a misunderstanding over a pair of stolen shoes.\r\n\r\nCredit http://www.cinema.com.my/movies/details.aspx?search=2014.10038.kasutkukusut.19509"}], "recommandations_id": []}
