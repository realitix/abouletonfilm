Under 30 minutes in length, this 1973 film shows Leary at his most engaging and personable. It\u2019s a testament to his considerable charm that he was able to pull off such a performance, considering that the prison warden and other officials were sitting across the room listening as this was filmed.  Leary discusses his jailbreak (intimating that the daughter of a United States senator he refuses to name helped him), the revolution in consciousness and drugs, Eldridge Cleaver and what it feels like to be an imprisoned philosopher.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yDIiEgaCmxQ9PCPPoWlF5OFOnnv.jpg", "actors": ["Timothy Leary (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
