With his sidekick Fuzzy Q. Jones (Al St. John), Rocky rides into a small town plagued by cattle rustlers. He can expect no help from the Law, since the sheriff is as crooked as the Yellow Brick Road. In fact, the sheriff is the head of the rustlers, meaning that Rocky's really got a dilemma on his hands this time out. The villain in Law of the Saddle is played by Lane Chandler, a former silent-film cowboy star who sustained his career into the 1960s by specializing in stubble-chinned heavies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jUvIMygP7R5rmGSl46rkxxY0vY1.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Livingston (Rocky Cameron aka The Lone Rider)", "Al St. John (Fuzzy Jones (as Al 'Fuzzy' St.John))", "Betty Miles (Gayle Kirby)", "Lane Chandler (Steve Kinney)", "John Elliott (Dan Kirby)", "Reed Howes (Sheriff Dave Barstowe)", "Curley Dresden (Henchman Joe (as Curly Dresden))", "Al Ferguson (Henchman Bart)", "Frank Ellis (Henchman Vic Dawson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
