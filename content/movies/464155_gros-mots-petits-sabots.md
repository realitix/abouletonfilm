This exhilarating film portrays a youth detention centre's young inhabitants thriving on the difficult task of building up a relationship with a horse. For these adolescents - who are at odds with society and have violent tendencies - building up a relationship with a horse is an opportunity to learn about trust and communication. The values with which horse whisperers work are transferred to human relationships and offer a way out from the vicious circle of violence.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
