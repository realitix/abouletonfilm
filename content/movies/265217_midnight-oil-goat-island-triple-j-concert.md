The concert was filmed, simulcast on ABC-TV and Triple J, and released on video, which was remastered for their 2004 Best of Both Worlds DVD.  Oils on the Water: A classic Midnight Oil performance was recorded on Goat Island in Sydney Harbour on 13 January 1985. Never before or since has the band performed in such a setting; every time Peter Garrett turned up stage he was caught in the light of the setting sun, reflected by the city and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uiaVksK79960JnC8NAFMRrdYEH.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Garrett (Vocals)", "Jim Moginie (guitar, keyboard)", "Jim Moginie (guitar)", "Rob Hirst (Drums, Vocal)", "Bones Hillman (Vocal, Bass)", "Peter Gifford (Vocal, Bass)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
