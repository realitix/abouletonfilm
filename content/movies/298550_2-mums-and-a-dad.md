One option presents itself in the form of Darren, a rather vociferous and iron-willed, gay British man who shares the couple's need for a child and clocks in as a strong candidate for sperm donor. The three consult with attorneys on the legal stipulations, then agree to move forward. Fiona's insemination passes without a hitch, but as the pregnancy rolls on, tempers begin to flare and open hostility erupts, raising serious questions about the emotional fortitude of this situation -- particularly the question of whether the baby is a strong enough force to bind everyone together and pull them through the tumult unscathed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9XUaA9hwRrwzSjDX0BtI2CddyWL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
