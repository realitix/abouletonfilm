These systems \u2014 some in the ground for more than 100 years \u2014 provide a critical public health function and are essential for economic development and growth. Largely out of sight and out of mind, these aging systems have not been maintained, and some estimates suggest this is the single largest public works endeavor in our nation\u2019s history.  Exploring the history, engineering challenges, and political and economic realities in urban and rural locations, the documentary provides an understanding of the hidden assets that support our way of life. Locations featured in the documentary include Atlanta, Boston, Herminie (Pennsylvania), Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ulDRcoNIY9KC8AhrxNNH9q1WvGC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7Cul30R0z-A"}
