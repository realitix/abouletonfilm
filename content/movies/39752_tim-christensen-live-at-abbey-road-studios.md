Additionally, the band had a really good year and was on a roll, so Christensen was happy to have it documented.  The concert was composed of two sets; one with full band, one unplugged. The setlists contained songs from the two solo albums that had been released by then, Secrets on Parade (2000) and Honeyburst (2003), as well as from the eponymous debut album of Christensen's former band, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy (1994).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jwcWACAqwvqDpYH4HIR1gWmyEsq.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Christensen (Guitars & Vocals)", "Lars Skj\u00e6rb\u00e6k (Guitars, Mellontron & Vocals)", "Nicolai Munch-Hansen (Bass)", "Olaf Olsen (Drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
