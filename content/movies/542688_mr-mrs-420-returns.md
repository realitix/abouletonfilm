They join their friend Palli (Yuvraj Hans) in a town for a better future and to prove themselves. The big problem is that this cannot be done until they have a place to stay. Then comes Babbu (Babbal Rai), friend of Palli, to their rescue. It does not last long because of their parting one night. They have to look for another shelter.
