Harry and Farina notice a rivalry between two very large young kids, Joe and Chubby, that would fill the bill if only the two heavyweights would put aside their gentle natures. Farina gets an idea: tell each of the lads that the other will take a dive in the second round. So the fight begins and the stands are filled; but will the combatants actually throw a punch? Ernie has one more trick up his sleeve to get the fists flying and the crowd on its feet. Sweet science indeed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HOZQU9b1STG0mhw858OLxZqufJ.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Aber (Boy sitting to the right of the tomato thrower)", "Norman Chaney (Chubby)", "Joe Cobb (Joe)", "Jackie Cooper (Jackie)", "Jean Darling (Jean)", "Charlie Hall (Sidewalk diner attendant)", "Allen 'Farina' Hoskins (Farina)", "Bobby 'Wheezer' Hutchins (Wheezer)", "Mary Ann Jackson (Mary Ann)", "Bobby Mallon (Announcer Graham McCracker)", "Billy Schuler (Extra)", "Andy Shuford (Chubby's trainer)", "Donnie 'Beezer' Smith (Beezer)", "Harry Spear (Harry)", "Dannie Mac Grant ((uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47509], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
