Time and space seem to compress or implode into a contradictory experience - one which is fluid, yet static, sculptural, yet two-dimensional, of the present yet of the past. The images are layered both horizontally and vertically, creating\r 'endless' variations of time and space which are unable to be contained within the fixed boundaries of the film frame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yla73lKt9esXDMp9eEGcwSloQNt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
