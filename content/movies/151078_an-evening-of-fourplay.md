The music sounds more or less like a Bob James small-group date with Ritenour as a major soloist. The style is between jazz, R&amp;B, and pop with an emphasis on lightweight originals, soulful and moderately funky rhythms, and predictable radio-friendly music. Nothing unexpected occurs, but fans of James and Ritenour should enjoy both this CD and Fourplay in general.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wpyVKB0tyPr6bRjn0crr2PpyOwl.jpg", "actors": ["Bob James (keyboards)", "Lee Ritenour (guitar)", "Harvey Mason (drums)", "Chaka Khan (vocal)", "Phillip Bailey (vocal)", "Phil Perry (vocal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
