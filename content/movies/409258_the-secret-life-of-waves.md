In an elegant and original film, he finds that waves are not made of water, that some waves travel sideways and that the sound of the ocean comes not from water but from bubbles. Waves are not only beautiful but also profoundly important, and there is a surprising connection between the life cycle of waves and the life of human beings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9j5rgLsydoba3kvBOXBDtk1fDP1.jpg", "actors": ["David Malone (Himself - Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
