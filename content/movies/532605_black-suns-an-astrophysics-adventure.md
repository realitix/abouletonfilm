It chronicles the lives of two globetrotting African American astrophysicists, Dr. Alphonse Sterling and Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi, as they follow the two solar eclipses that occurred in 2012. Dr. Alphonse Sterling of NASA, stationed in Japan, had early success in the US, but left his home country to further cultivate his wide-ranging interests. Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi of the Florida Institute of Technology, is a scientist who beat the odds of poverty, and a poor early education, to get where he is today. The film is hosted by award-winning cultural astronomer Dr. Jarita Holbrook.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/stmIHFUYdNooV7hzsi56vsNyOrT.jpg", "actors": ["Dr. Alphonse Sterling ()", "Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
