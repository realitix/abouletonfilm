It is named after Zorn's lemma (also known as the Kuratowski\u2013Zorn lemma), a proposition of set theory formulated by mathematician Max Zorn in 1935.  Zorns Lemma is prefaced with a reading from an early grammar textbook. The remainder of the film, largely silent, shows the viewer an evolving 24-part \"alphabet\" (composed initially of street signs photographed in New York City) which is cycled through, replaced and expanded upon. The film's conclusion shows a man, woman and dog walking through snow as several voices read passages from On Light, or the Ingression of Forms, by Robert Grosseteste.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ovAeLJTYnYk4Uihg1OqT1SSEmLI.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Huot ()", "Rosemarie Castoro ()", "Marcia Steinbrecher ()", "Twyla Tharp ()", "Joyce Wieland ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [145619, 132161, 93507, 145915], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
