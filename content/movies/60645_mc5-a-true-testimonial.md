Starting from their mid-60's garage band roots (sounding amazingly like the Sonics), the Motor City 5 deveoped into an icon for a brand of loud, crushing music reflecting their industrial roots. Even if you don't care for their music (and you're bound to like even a few of their songs), their story is fascinating. It combines 60's protest, youthful braggadocio, and a style of music that would help carry one to the likes of Iggy and the Stooges (not to mention certain aspects of punk rock). This film is clearly a labor of love, combining extraordinarily rare live shows, still shots, a nearly-continuous backdrop of MC5 tunes, penetrating interviews with the remaining members and their spouses, and even FBI surveillance shots. It's the ultimate testimonial to a band that only gains in stature as time goes on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lPL1qnWIo4mhfSwApaFIRMEeG9D.jpg", "actors": ["Rob Tyner (Himself)", "Wayne Kramer (Himself)", "Fred Smith (Himself)", "Michael Davis (Himself)", "Dennis Thompson (Himself)", "John Sinclair (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qvFopfP3znU"}
