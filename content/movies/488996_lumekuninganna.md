The unusual love story is based on the motifs of H. C. Andersen's fairytale. A woman living in an ice castle lures a boy to her. He becomes so spellbound by the woman and her land of ice that he forgets the real world. The woman hides the secret of why she is living in the cold from the boy. Those, who know the original story by H.C. Andersen, will also remember that only a few lines spoke of the relationship between the boy and the Snow Queen. The question remained unanswered: what did the boy and the Snow Queen do in the ice castle for all of the time the girl spent looking for the boy?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xUCwhpq9Or1dzCymPv9TEbutsno.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
