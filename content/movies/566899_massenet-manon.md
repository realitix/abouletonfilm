Based on Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost\u2019s novel, the opera tells the story of the unlucky love of Chevalier des Grieux for Manon, the girl\u2019s adventurous life, her love for luxury and her death in squalid conditions, while Des Grieux\u2019s tries to keep himself away from her. Massenet renders the ambience of each situation through a music that is lively, full of passion and most of all sensuality, and with a style expressing in the liveliest way the French belle \u00e9poque, its aesthetics and values.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ryD8vtLYLX0KZyEZjUQKLHOIBRn.jpg", "actors": ["Myrt\u00f2 Papatanasiu (Manon Lescaut)", "Konstantinos Klironomos (The Chevalier des Grieux)", "Dionysios Sourbis (Lescaut)", "Tassos Apostolou (The Count des Grieux)", "Lukas Karytinos (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AvCSjkkVyhM"}
