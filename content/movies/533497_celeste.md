Besides having a regular mistress in the person of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, he is a ladies man with \"a girl in every port\". But this comfortable situation is challenged the day he hires C\u00e9leste as his housemaid. A Portuguese immigrant, she soon appears to be a Marxist-Leninist activist, engaged in political groups working against the regime of Salazar, the dictator of Portugal. Geoges and C\u00e9leste fall in love with each other, which brings adventure in the reporter's hitherto superficial life, upset by a breakup with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the interference of the French Secret Service and a touch of terrorism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cVsc1cCgWYWL3STvYNsYz1EJTZj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
