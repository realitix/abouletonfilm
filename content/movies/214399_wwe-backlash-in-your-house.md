It was the 28th and final event to be promoted under the In Your House banner, as shortly thereafter the WWF decided to give their monthly pay-per-views permanent names; Backlash became the name for the post-WrestleMania pay-per-view beginning in 2000 and retained that name until 2009.  The main event was a rematch from WrestleMania, featuring Steve Austin wrestling The Rock for the WWF Championship \u2013 this time with a no disqualification stipulation and a special guest referee. Lower down on the card, Paul Wight and Mankind had a Boiler Room Brawl to settle matters after their previous encounter, which decided who would referee the WrestleMania event. Triple H also wrestled X-Pac due to Triple H causing X-Pac to lose a match for the European Championship the previous month.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sIPInGx90rmgH59KWMYGtjT7AIu.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Austin (Stone Cold Steve Austin)", "Dwayne Johnson (The Rock)", "Mark William Calaway (The Undertaker)", "Ken Shamrock (Himself)", "Paul Michael L\u00e9vesque (Triple H)", "Sean Michael Waltman (X-Pac)", "Mick Foley (Mankind)", "Paul Wight (Big Show)", "Brian Girard James (Road Dogg)", "Monty Kip Sopp (Bad Ass Billy Gunn)", "Owen James Hart (Himself)", "Jeff Jarrett (Himself)", "Charles Wright (The Godfather)", "Dustin Runnels (Goldust)", "Brian Daniel Heffron (The Blue Meanie)", "Allen Sarven (Al Snow)", "Robert Howard (Hardcore Holly)", "John Charles Layfield (Bradshaw)", "Ron Simmons (Faarooq)", "Dennis Knight (Mideon)", "Adam Copeland (Edge)", "William Jason Reso (Christian)", "David Heath (Gangrel)", "Chyna (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zW5-Yg-j1V4"}
