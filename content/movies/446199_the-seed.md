Saokam, a farmer, takes some paddy to grow in his field, while Buarian just keeps one seed for worship. Since then, Saokam keeps growing rice with that paddy. Ten years later, the paddy fields suffer a drought. There is not enough water, even for drinking or bathing.  Some have to mortgage their own fields to pay the bills, while Buarian takes advantage of her neighbor's poverty. Fortunately, Saokam's son has a chance to work with the King's project to produce artificial rain. In addition, he also persuades other farmers to join the Royal Agricultural Project. As a result, their crop output increases. The Seed was made to celebrate of His Majesty's 5th Cycle Birthday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sipOFqtmqWwwQ6IfxWiklQiNHOZ.jpg", "actors": ["Jaran Manopet (Saokham)", "Chintara Sukapatana (Saokhaeo)", "Santisuk Promsiri (Khamnueng)", "Rome Isara (Sam-ang)", "Krailad Kriangkrai (Khampan)", "Narumon Nillawan (Buarian)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Af43_I7cpR8"}
