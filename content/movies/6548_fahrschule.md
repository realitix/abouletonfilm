One of them Steinkoehler bought out of pity from a friend who needed the money to pay off his divorced wife, whereas the second one his wife Gisela secretly ordered years ago and has now just arrived. Both of them enroll in a driving school. For Steinkoehler, the lessons, or more precisely the driving instructor named Hempel, are nightmarish. Hempel exercises his powers to their fullest extent with Steinkoehler. In addition, Steinkoehler becomes jealous when his wife Gisela distinctly mixes very well with her own driving instructor. Yet fate would have it that a flighty, young, female driving student mistakes him for a driving instructor. Her devotion both lifts and confuses him with equal measure, but he is nevertheless determined to use this unexpected opportunity for adventure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nThl7XWrBPVWQEX8Bdgv9PHd5zO.jpg", "actors": ["J\u00f6rg Gudzuhn (Steink\u00f6hler)", "Detlef Heintze (Reschke)", "Daniela Hoffmann (Elvira)", "Kata K\u00e1nya (Gisela)", "Otto Mellies (Hempel)", "Simone von Zglinicki (Maria)", "Steffie Spira (Resolute alte Dame)", "Jaecki Schwarz (Arzt)", "Hilmar Baumann (Hauptwachtmeister Schaarschmidt)", "Marylu Poolman (Porzellanverk\u00e4uferin)", "Bodo Kr\u00e4mer ()", "Carl-Hermann Risse ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
