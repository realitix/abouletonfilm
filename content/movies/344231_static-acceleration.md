This was then re-recorded by camera from a monitor with the action being gradually slowed down to play at a constant rate in time with a series of loud regular beats. Using the alarmingly small tape-speed knob on the 1970s Sony edit deck to progressively slow down the action, the movement of the head stretches the ability of the record-head drum to coherently represent the action, while also displaying its own technical limitations.\" D.C.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5U50kKvQYHbVABKU31wYFHf0uhM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
