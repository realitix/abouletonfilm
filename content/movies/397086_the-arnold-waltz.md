He sits idly through lessons. Then, it's time for band, where he plays the piccolo. He daydreams through the Vienna waltz, imagining himself ice-skating, and sending the school bully into the cold water by cutting a circle through the ice around him. The band plays a second song, and Arnold imagines spring. The music ends, the room empties except for Arnold. The teacher says, \"Arnold, everybody's gone to recess.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
