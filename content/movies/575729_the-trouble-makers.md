He's been living in a hotel. To save money, he rents from the loquacious Baby - paying three months' rent and a hefty deposit - to share a flat with a lovely unemployed fashion designer, Miss Clary. Clary and Ginyi seem to hit it off, as friends, and he hires her to do the cooking and cleaning while she looks for work.
