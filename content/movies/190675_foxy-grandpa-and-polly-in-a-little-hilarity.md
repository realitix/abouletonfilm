Here, they enter from our left, hand in hand, a sylvan backdrop behind them. They're in fancy dress: he in three-piece suit and tie, bowler hat in hand; she in frilly floor-length dress, hat, and long braid of hair behind. They do a carefully choreographed dance - he's comic with large nose and male-pattern baldness splitting white curly hair; she's festive and smiling. They stay in sync. The camera is stationary, and it's one take.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0BTSfsLTFkqXgta1hLw1nuQZc5.jpg", "actors": ["Carrie DeMar (Polly)", "Joseph Hart (Foxy Grandpa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
