Mais la qui\u00e9tude recherch\u00e9e n'est que de fa\u00e7ade... Une affaire vieille de 50 ans le hante encore et toujours. Malheureusement seuls quelques fragments sont encore vivaces : une altercation avec un \u00e9poux en col\u00e8re, un lien profond mais myst\u00e9rieux avec son \u00e9pouse fragile. Si son l\u00e9gendaire pouvoir de d\u00e9duction n'est plus intact, et si Watson n'est plus l\u00e0, Holmes va se lancer dans son ultime enqu\u00eate, la plus compliqu\u00e9e de sa longue carri\u00e8re...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2mgsukK55OrMANIe5BbOcaGr4RX.jpg", "actors": ["Ian McKellen (Sherlock Holmes)", "Milo Parker (Roger)", "Laura Linney (Mrs. Munro)", "Hattie Morahan (Ann Kelmot)", "Patrick Kennedy (Thomas Kelmot)", "Hiroyuki Sanada (Tamiki Umezaki)", "Colin Starkey (Dr. John Watson)", "Zak Shukor (Matsuda Umezaki)", "Roger Allam (Dr. Barrie)", "Phil Davis (Inspector Gilbert)", "Sarah Crowden (Mrs. Hudson)", "Frances de la Tour (Madame Schirmer)", "Hermione Corfield (Matinee 'Ann Kelmot')", "Frances Barber (Matinee 'Madame Schirmer')", "John Sessions (Mycroft Holmes)", "Michael Culkin (Bank Manager)", "Eileen Davies (Lady on Platform)", "Charles Maddox (Oswald)", "Takako Akashi (Maya Umezaki)", "David Foxxe (Chemist)", "Oliver Devoti (Ticket Agent)", "Mike Burnside (Ann's Solicitor)", "Nicholas Rowe (Matinee 'Sherlock')", "Sam Coulson (Matinee 'Kelmot')", "Kit Connor (Boy)", "Zoe Rainey (Boy's Mother)", "Elizabeth Jane Cassidy (Waitress (uncredited))", "Ben Farrow (Bank Clerk (uncredited))", "John Carr (Patron in Cinema (uncredited))"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Reno", "content": "> The famous English detective at his old age.\r\n\r\nIan McKellen as Sherlock Holmes, totally loved it. Directed by an Oscar winning filmmaker, the film was based on the novel 'A Slight Trick of the Mind'. It focused the long retired Sherlock Holmes, who now lives in the English countryside where he meets a boy. He tries to recall one of his old cases, but struggles as he's very old to remember. So with the help of the boy, he undertakes to correct the book version of the story and besides, they together establish beekeeping as a hobby.\r\n\r\nIt was not that great, though an enjoyable small drama. Having a greatest detective character in it, you just can't expect a boring regular drama of the life. The narration had a multiple layer, in each how much Mr. Holmes dedicates himself to solves the case was nicely told. And of course, all of them had its own twist. After all, that's what everybody seeks from a film with Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you would have seen several films and/or series based on this character, but this film was something unique and only one kind, except if there's a sequel planned for this. Some people might be disappointed in this for being somewhat simple, but for a 93 year old man this storyline looked very appropriate and Ian did a fantastic job. I anticipated someone young actor for those flashback parts, but in the end, I'm happy that it was a one man show as it should be. It is a must see for his fans.\r\n\r\n7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [294016, 49517, 268238, 239563]}
