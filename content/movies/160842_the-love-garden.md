His bubble is instantly burst when he discovers she's a sister of Sappho who already has a beautiful girlfriend named Inez. Being a macho kind of Seventies guy, he honestly believes that he can change Claire's sexual preference. Mike offers her a position as his personal secretary after she's fired from her job. Their day-to-day contact brings them closer together much to the dismay of a jealous Inez.
