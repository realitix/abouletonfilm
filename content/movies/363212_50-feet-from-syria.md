A successful hand surgeon in the United States, Hisham decides he cannot continue to watch images of wounded Syrian refugees flow across international borders without acting on his impulse to help. Hisham\u2019s journey serves as a portal into one of today\u2019s most brutal, dehumanizing conflicts and into the lives of remarkable people working to save lives at great personal risk.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2wwQGwnOce0nj27qrwZAObAsSfv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
