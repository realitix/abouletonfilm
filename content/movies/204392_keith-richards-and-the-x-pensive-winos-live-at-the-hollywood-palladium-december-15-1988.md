Set-list is made up mostly with tracks from Richards Talk Is Cheap LP with a few rare Stones numbers mixed in. Keith, as always, is the living embodiment of rock and roll and this show, released in 1991 on VHS and then 2002 on DVD, is a great document of the tour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ocB0exukzXFXE4Ztdnt5QG7rXcH.jpg", "actors": ["Keith Richards ()", "Bobby Keys ()", "Steve Jordan ()", "Waddy Wachtel ()", "Ivan Neville ()", "Sarah Dash ()", "Charlie Drayton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
