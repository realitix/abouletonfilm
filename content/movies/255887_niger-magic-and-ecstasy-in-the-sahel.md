Tuareg Electric Guitar trance rock, Bori cult dance ceremonies, Fulani Folk, and Roadhouse Gospel Rave-ups are some of the segments included in this latest \"Folk Cinema\" classic from Sublime Frequencies! Filmed in December of 2004 on location in Niger, Hisham Mayet delivers a spontaneous, raw, and inspiring collection of images, music, and ceremony (again with a single camera presentation) from a nation mired in poverty and continual post-colonial disappointment. Quoting from Mayet\u2019s liner notes: \"This is not music as commodity, this is music as survival. There is a saying in Niger that goes, \"when we die we know we are going to heaven because we already live in Hell\" well I think its more like the purgatory that we all live in and they sure have managed to transcend with an incredible natural resource: Music. Dig it!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hviKOrgPGkoUuHpLWteW64xyzjO.jpg", "actors": ["Group Inerane (Performer)", "Ouragan Del Air (Performer)", "Mohamed Tenna (Performer)", "Abdou Yahaya (Performer)", "Boubon Griots (Performer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sfB1NxM0ClU"}
