He hasn't seen her for several years and has just taken her away from the boarding school she was immured in. She is now 15, and for some reason is doing everything in her power to get him to have sex with her. She even brings herself to orgasm while lying in the bed next to him. He goes nearly apoplectic trying to avoid her advances. Eventually, her school chum Therese comes to visit them, and Guido at last has a semi-suitable object for his by now quite overheated passions. The story is loosely based on a novel by Guido Morselli.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sKDgRxD8y5FgL0AjAxOArXNvREs.jpg", "actors": ["Franco Nero (Guido)", "Lara Wendel (Mimmina)", "Dalila Di Lazzaro (Therese)", "Carlo Bagno (Doctor Vanetti)", "Felicita Montrone (Chambermaid)", "Silvio Pascorelli (Porter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
