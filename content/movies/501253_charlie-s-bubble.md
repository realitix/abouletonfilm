Philip Chan made his solo directorial debut with a film based on his own adolescent fantasy, about a secondary school student who falls in love with his teacher. The teacher happens to be pregnant and, after the kid makes the vow to help her take care of the child, the father reappears to assume his responsibilities\u2026Is teenage bubble going to burst? Chan had the foresight \u2013 or was it luck? \u2013 to hand over writing chores to Alfred Cheung, who turned the potentially controversial story into a script of nuanced emotions and morality while managing to avoid the sensational. Charlie's Bubble, which escaped critical attention in its initial release, is a work that deserves a second look.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yGgIVrQfOE2aroVo9REtmJuXO5u.jpg", "actors": ["Cheung Kwok-Keung ()", "Ping-Ping Ha ()", "Dennis Chan ()", "Tso-Yee Chan ()", "Yeuk-Hon Fung ()", "Lai Siu-Fong ()", "Shan Liang ()", "John Sham ()", "Lo-Tak Tsang ()", "Ai-Ti Wan ()", "Wong Ching ()", "Chun Yang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
