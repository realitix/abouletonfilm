Eyes on stilts, color patterns, pinchered walking feet, a rostrum. We watch shrimp eat using a strong claw and a fine one; we watch digestion. After eating, shrimp clean themselves. The female lays eggs that cling to her feet. After three weeks, the eggs hatch explosively. Few larvae live to adulthood. We watch an adult shed its carapace with a final leap, leaving it vulnerable; other shrimp attack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cdwVC18URfEdQjjxqJyRMoGDC0H.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [183469, 282393, 283688, 128702], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
