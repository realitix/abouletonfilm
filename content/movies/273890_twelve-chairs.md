It tells both of yesterday and today, the reality of the people in the CIS countries and the universal humanity of our own actions. Large social utopia thus mixes with the individual hope of personal happiness, be it through money or in love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1n5ay7Y9Wgz6D8C2bdM5SYGNdW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
