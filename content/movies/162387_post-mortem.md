Linda (Sylvie Moreau) is a devoted single mother who will do anything to support her five-year-old daughter, Charlotte (Sarah Lecompte-Bergeron). Unfortunately, a lot of what Linda does best isn't exactly legal, such as luring well-to-do men into the park and then mugging them. One night, Linda is trying to coax a visitor from America into the shadows when the situation starts to go wrong. Meanwhile, Ghislain (Gabriel Arcand) is a shy, lonely fellow who works at the morgue and likes to listen to the blues late at night. In time, we discover that Linda and Ghislain met at one time, leading to an ugly encounter for both of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sqA96MvpR3sWRUonbHXhAeBjWYK.jpg", "actors": ["Gabriel Arcand (Ghislain O'Brien)", "Sylvie Moreau (Linda Faucher)", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Loiselle (Madame Faucher)", "Sarah Lecomte-Bergeron ()", "Ghislain Taschereau ()", "Yves B\u00e9langer (Police Officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
