The Emperor Meiji is deeply concerned, for Russia has started to build an invincible fortress at Port Arthur, and the relations between two countries have become strained to breaking point. General Nogi has retired to the first reserve and is now a gentleman farmer, but he is prepared for sudden mobilization. Finally, Japan declares war against Russia and Emperor Meiji appoints General Nogi as the commander of the force to attack Port Arthur. However, in spite of several all-out attacks, the fortress is strong and the casualties increase among the Japanese. Because of these reverses, there are loud cries for a change in command. However, the Emperor places his confidence in General Nogi.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kanj\u00fbr\u00f4 Arashi (Emperor Meiji)", "Miyuki Takakura (Empress Sh\u00f4ken)", "Hiroshi Hayashi (General Nogi Maresuke)", "Hikosaburo Kataoka (Katsunori, Nogi's first son)", "Keinosuke Wada ()", "Sachiko Murase (Shizuko)", "Toshiaki Konoe ()", "Y\u00f4ichi Numata (General Kodama Gentar\u00f4)", "Shuntar\u00f4 Emi ()", "Shinsuke Mikimoto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
