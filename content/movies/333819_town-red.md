Patrick, a mechanic and farmer, who has lost everything he's ever loved to this peculiar plague, and Jeffrey, his trusted worker and friend, find a young boy possessed by this affliction trapped in their garage. As they plot to find him and put him out of his misery, Neil, an insolent local farmer, shows up with his own agenda to get out of the town.
