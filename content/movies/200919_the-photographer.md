On the night before his make-or-break gallery opening, surrounded by the trappings of success but devoid of inspiration, Max embarks on a bizarre trek through the city in search of ten mysterious photographs that could save his career. Shot in brilliant color and dramatic black and white, first-time director Jeremy Stein's industrial New York City is a wonderland, roamed by witches and magical creatures, where survival hinges on the completion of a simple quest. Accompanied by an unlikely crew of strangers he meets along the way, Max trips through a modern-day Oz and rediscovers the easily forgotten value of seeing magic reflected in everyday life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i809jRahJ12eBVHgx5AnDpz04Fd.jpg", "actors": ["Reg Rogers (Max Martin)", "Tina Holmes (Amy)", "Anthony Michael Hall (Greg)", "Marisa Berenson (Julie Morris)", "Kristen Wilson (Schuyler)", "Tom Noonan (Butler)", "Josh Stamberg (Peter Morgan)", "John Heard (Marcello)", "Michael Shannon (Maurice)", "Maggie Gyllenhaal (Mira)", "Chris Bauer (Paul)", "Siobhan Fallon Hogan (Crazy Lady)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
