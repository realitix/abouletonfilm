When he meets Othonas, however, they quarrel because the detective hadn\u2019t worked seriously enough on the case. Afterwards, Stathis takes control of his old gang again and sets up a few new scams, selling dreams and hopes to simple people. He soon realizes that he has lost his old love, Vana, who, while he was in prison, had become involved with his second-in- command, Michalis. Nevertheless, his bitterness is softened by Stella, Vana\u2019s sister, who works at the Red Cross. He falls for her, and she responds in kind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iJfJ6eoFZhLvLmAKrnpsOOjnPnA.jpg", "actors": ["Nikos Kourkoulos (Stathis Kougias)", "Mairi Hronopoulou (Stella)", "Voula Harilaou (Vana)", "Yorgos Moutsios (Mihalis)", "Spyros Kalogirou (Thanasis)", "Despo Diamantidou (Roza)", "Giannis Vogiatzis (Othonas Lappas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
