From a director who has shown reverence for military values, you might expect a painstakingly conscientious propaganda film. That\u2019s what you get here, complete with diagrams and explanatory narration. \r\n\r\nThe emphasis is about equal between historic personalities and epic battles, both depicted with detachment and restraint, both almost bloodless by the standards of today. Confrontations are dignified, carnage is comparatively decorous. \r\n\r\nToshiro Mifune and a debonair Tatsuya Nakadai stand out among a fine studio cast. Foreign actors playing Russians\u2026 well, less was expected of them. The unseen star is technical director Eiji Tsuburaya. At times you can all but smell the coal smoke from his model warships. \r\n\r\nThe English subtitles are so flawed that they conclude with an apology. They\u2019re still preferable to the English-language version incongruously dubbed by an American vocal cast."}], "recommandations_id": []}
