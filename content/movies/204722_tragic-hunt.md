{"tmdb_id": 204722, "title": "Tragic Hunt", "original_title": "Caccia tragica", "slug_title": "tragic-hunt", "date": "1947-11-04", "genre": ["Drame / Action"], "score": "5.5/10", "synopsis": "Set amongst the Italian peasantry of WW2, Caccia Tragica (Tragic Chase) is set in motion when a truck loaded with money targetted for farming projects is stolen by bandits. The local villagers set aside their petty political and personal differences, banding together to capture the outlaws and recover the loot. The story takes a romantic detour by concentrating on the romance between two young people caught in the middle between the pursuers and the pursued. At the time of its release, Caccia Tragica was perceived as a Communist tract (it was produced by the left-leaning National Association of Italian Partisans). This didn't prevent the film from winning an award at the 1947 Venice Film Festival, quite a coup for first-time director Giueseppe De Santis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3OZbjnSmJak9ZSuDkr1pORmtvHT.jpg", "actors": ["Vivi Gioi (Daniela 'Lili Marlene')", "Andrea Checchi (Alberto)", "Carla Del Poggio (Giovanna)", "Vittorio Duse (Giuseppe)", "Massimo Girotti (Michele)", "Checco Rissone (Mim\u00ec)", "Umberto Sacripante (Il zoppo)", "Alfredo Salvatori (Un fattore)", "Folco Lulli (Un fattore)", "Michele Riccardini (Il maresciallo)", "Eugenia Grandi (Sultana)", "Piero Lulli (L'autista)", "Guido Della Valle (Il tedesco)", "Ermanno Randi (Andrea)", "Massimo Rossini (Il camoscio)", "Enrico Tacchetti (Il ragioniere)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
