Part road movie, part time travel, her journey tells the story of what happened to life in the largest forest on Earth when a road was built straight through its heart. Zmekhol's cinematic journey combines intimate interviews with her personal and poetic meditation on environmental devastation, resistance, and renewal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25okzX0wkRbNvnZeFJzxSmNaZI1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
