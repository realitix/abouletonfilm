And who would say that these same kids literally from the other side of the world, influenced by those artists, were starting to create a strong and lively hip-hop culture in Porto, Portugal? In a journey that begins in the late 80s when the first echoes of American hip-hop began to shyly arrive in Portugal through television (MTV), movies (\"Style Wars\", \"Beat Street\") and radio, the documentary takes a deep look at the history and memories of Porto's rap culture until today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
