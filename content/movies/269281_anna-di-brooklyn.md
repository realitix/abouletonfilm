{"tmdb_id": 269281, "title": "Anna di Brooklyn", "original_title": "Anna di Brooklyn", "slug_title": "anna-di-brooklyn", "date": "1958-04-18", "genre": ["Com\u00e9die / Romance"], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "In this occasionally amusing frolic, Gina Lollobrigida plays a sexy widow who returns to Italy from New York following the death of her husband. Her wealth and good looks entice all the men in her small village except for the one she really wants, the town blacksmith (Dale Robertson). Giuseppe Rotunno's warm cinematography and the irresistible Lollobrigida make this one worth seeing, while the screenplay (by Ettore Margadonna, Luciana Corda, and Joseph Stefano) manages to be clever without being smirky. Look for a funny bit by Vittorio DeSica, who supervised some scenes, as a loquacious priest. This film is also known as both Anna of Brooklyn and Fast and Sexy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sZpGKg8ZU2LdVuPXu3lQvZNqFyE.jpg", "actors": ["Terence Hill (Ciccillo)", "Gina Lollobrigida (Anna)", "Vittorio De Sica (Don Luigi)", "Dale Robertson (Raffaele)", "Amedeo Nazzari (Ciccone)", "Carla Macelloni (Rosina)", "Gabriella Pallotta (Mariuccia)", "Luigi De Filippo (Zitto-Zitto)", "Clelia Matania (Camillina)", "Augusta Ciolli (Zia Carmela)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
