The story appears to be one of a young \"Westernized\" Chinese couple living in America and the cultural clash they experience with the man's traditional family. The movie has no surviving intertitles (if it ever had any), so there's room for interpretation. Formally premiering in 1917, this film did not thereafter receive commercial distribution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/89tJzlKZnFm6PajxUspR8IIV1c1.jpg", "actors": ["Violet Wong (The Bride (uncredited))", "Marion E.
