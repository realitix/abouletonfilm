It was written and presented by Alistair Cooke, and first broadcast in both the United Kingdom and the United States in 1972.  The series was a great success in both countries and won a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA. It also resulted in Cooke's invitation to address the joint Houses of the United States Congress as part of the Bicentennial celebrations. Cooke said that, of all his work, America was what he was most proud of; it is the result and expression of his long love for the country. (Once, asked how long it took him to make the series, Cooke replied \"I do not want to be coy, but it took 40 years.\")", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u53SkAfQCvk2Uh19HYtjP3jbtlO.jpg", "actors": ["Alistair Cooke (Narrator/Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
