I smiled and nodded : \"Of course\". \r\n\r\nAh Beng's reaction to being asked to cancel his \u00adChinese New Year holiday to go on a mission with a RM1 million reward is hilarious.  His character was for me the source of several laugh-out-loud comedic moments, while some of the dramatic moments fall flat.\r\n\r\nWhile pacing and plot could be improved, the movie delivered as a Lunar New Year comedy, complete with the \"harmonious family\" ending, which is meta-comedic in itself."}], "recommandations_id": []}
