His new girlfriend, Valerie, drags him to church after a night of pre-marital sin. He is impressed with the amount of money given to Valerie's church, and he's especially impressed with the reverend's $70,000 Hummer. Robert and his stoner friend, Gary, realize that being a preacher is a lot like acting - you memorize a monologue, you put on a costume, you do a show, and people give you money. So Robert and Gary decide to create their own church and Robert transforms into the Rockin' Reverend. His sermons are controversial, being an agnostic. As he becomes successful, he is tempted by greed, lust, and drugs. He must choose between being a rock star reverend or being a good father, loyal friend, faithful boyfriend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/QFHEqKmmd8Z4CVReWcwq897xsM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
