It explored performances of liberation and political nakedness; and responded to the changing landscape of Dutch politics following the assassinations of controversial Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn in 2001 and film director Theo van Gogh in 2004, and the ensuing popularity of Geert Wilders, the Dutch politician and leader of the far-right Partij voor de Vrijheid [Party for Freedom].  Including newly commissioned punk, experimental and contemporary classical music by Finnish composer Timo-Juhani Kyll\u00f6nen, all-girl post-punk band Woolf, and London-based musician Morgan Quaintance, the Party for Freedom moving-image work featured an irreverent array of characters and scenarios, developed through workshops and filmed in the lush setting of a 13th-century church in the English countryside.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hvolFMYygwqTxeV84ooPRGq4sbO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
