Pic tells the story of a group of miners living in a camp in outback Australia. They swear, brawl, gamble, and drink heavily. Central to the story is the conflict between Tarzan, the authoritarian group leader and cocky loud-mouth wisecracking Pansy. This results in a bare-knuckle punch-up for the movie's denouement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m0vrfIBa6wj3r8GZqPv367ClwIe.jpg", "actors": ["Gerard Kennedy (Tarzan)", "Michael Preston (Pansy)", "Peter Hehir (Tom)", "Dennis Miller (Horse)", "Michael Caton (Monk)", "Steve Rackman (Carl)", "Michael Duffield (Methuselah)", "Steve Bisley (Mad Dog)", "Stewart Faichney (Tassie)", "Gerry Duggan (Old Arthur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
