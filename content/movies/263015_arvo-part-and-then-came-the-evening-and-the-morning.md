He is interviewed/provides voiceover in Estonian/Russian with subtitled English translations. Concert rehearsals (The Hilliard Ensemble/ Western Wind Choir/Paul Hillier) (unknown Finnish choir &amp; orchestra/Eri Klas) and a studio session (Arvo P\u00e4rt: Yamaha DX7 keyboard, Jan Garbarek: tenor saxophone &amp; Manfred Eicher: engineer) for the unreleased recording of what is reputedly Aetos are shown. Also a few minutes of the Kremer/Grindenko/Schnittke /Sondeckis Tabula Rasa performance is shown which would lead one to think that there is a complete video recording of that as well as the WDR Radio recording used for the ECM release. The tone of the documentary alternates from serious interviews/work to humorous scenes of P\u00e4rt clowning around and German \"man on the street\" interviews with people being asked \"Who is Arvo P\u00e4rt?\". Overall, a fascinating view into P\u00e4rt's work and lifestyle. - Alan Teder", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xuP49D7GAo0dPmXJykhkyA35M6v.jpg", "actors": ["Arvo P\u00e4rt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
