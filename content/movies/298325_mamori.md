The raw material of images and sounds was captured in the Amazon rainforest by filmmaker Karl Lemieux and avant-garde composer Francisco L\u00f3pez, a specialist in field recordings. Re-filming the photographs on 16 mm stock, then developing the film stock itself and digitally editing the whole, Lemieux transmutes the raw images and accompanying sounds into an intense sensory experience at the outer limits of representation and abstraction. Fragmented musical phrases filter through the soundtrack, evoking in our imagination the clamour of the tropical rainforest in this remote Amazonian location called Mamori.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fLdtgTDb03gna4KEuD4jN9ujnDb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
