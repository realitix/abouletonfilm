She loves her idle boyfriend Raoul who gambles away what little she earns. The town's power broker, called the rich Jew, discovers she is a good listener, so she's soon busy. Raoul imagines grotesque sex scenes between Lily and the Jew; he leaves her for a man. Her parents, a bitter Fascist who is a cabaret singer in drag and her wheelchair-bound mother, offer no refuge. Even though all have a philosophical bent, the other whores reject Lily because she tolerates everyone, including men. She tires of her lonely life and looks for a way out. Even that act serves the local corrupt powers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n7ktn7ALySBI9YrUvWRJZYzm5gU.jpg", "actors": ["Ingrid Caven (Lily Brest)", "Rainer Werner Fassbinder (Raoul)", "Klaus L\u00f6witsch (Jude)", "Jean-Claude Dreyfus (Zwerg)", "Debria Kalpataru (Marie-Antoinette)", "Annemarie D\u00fcringer (Luise M\u00fcller)", "Adrian Hoven (Herr M\u00fcller)", "Boy Gobert (Polizeichef)", "Ulli Lommel (Der kleine Prinz)", "Irm Hermann (Emma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
