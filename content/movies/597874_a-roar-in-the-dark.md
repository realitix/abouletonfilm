The film tells the story of what happens to T-Rex when he wakes up one morning to learn that he can't roar and chronicles the ordeal he must go through to get it back. As much as I love genre film I still wanted to be critical of the masculine tropes predominant in film and using the characters of T-Rex and his friends was a unique way to highlight the more absurd aspects of these stories.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
