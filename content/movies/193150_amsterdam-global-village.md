{"tmdb_id": 193150, "title": "Amsterdam Global Village", "original_title": "Amsterdam Global Village", "slug_title": "amsterdam-global-village", "date": "1996-10-09", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "6.5/10", "synopsis": "\"I am far away on a distant journey through my own city\", filmmaker Johan van der Keuken says at the end of his four-hour portrait of Amsterdam. The city is presented as a place where people from all corners of the world live, who all exert their cultural influence on the life in the city. With a motor courier as his central figure, the filmmaker introduces the audience to birds of different feathers. We see diverse cultural expressions, like the house scene, the entry of St. Nicholas and a Ghanese mourning ritual. The binding factor in the film is the concept of 'travelling', in other words Amsterdam as a global village. The camera travels through the film in three ways: over land, over water (canals) and through the air.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bVMvErfCLNcFI1TVins2NdZOe27.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
