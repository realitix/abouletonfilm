In her dance she shakes, twists and turns around in a very energetic dance. The elements of Turkish folklore can be felt despite the lack of sound as the differences from this and other belly dances are very notorious when her traditional Turkish dress swings in a marvellous way as she dances. Unlike other films about exotic dances, Lola's movies (the other was \"Ella Lola, a la Trilby\") were of a less erotic nature and more focused on the realistic representation of the dance. A professional dancer since a very young age, Lola's dancing is very graceful and showcases an enormous control over her body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xoOpsMgbj0Hw7aZylSke3nB1GA8.jpg", "actors": ["Ella Lola (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [190727, 189268, 190636, 189810], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
