Karl and his mother are about to learn this when they move from the west coast of Denmark to the ethnically and religiously mixed area of N\u00f8rrebro in Copenhagen. Sawsan, a Danish-Turkish girl in Karl\u2019s new class, takes him under her wings and tries to integrate him into the big city, with all its slang and hipness. Sawsan is far more experienced and blunt than most \u2013 especially compared to Karl, this young Danish boy from the provinces. Sawsan\u2019s big dream comes true when one of her songs is chosen for the Danish version of the Eurovision Song Contest for kids. Sawsan\u2019s father of course says no, but Karl has a plan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/33nIZ7CGr5pg0XodRvzUNUfPavt.jpg", "actors": ["Sylvester Espersen Byder (Karl H\u00f8jby Hansen)", "Malika Sia Graff (Sawsan)", "Line Kruse (Eva)", "Ali Kazim (Kumail)", "Natali Vallespir (Jamilah)", "Lars Knutzon (Karl's Grandfather)", "Mian Hussein (Sawsan's Cousin)", "Joakim Ingversen (Teacher)", "Laura Christensen (L\u00e6rke)", "Laura Drasb\u00e6k (DR-girl)", "Birgit Conradi ()", "Nima Nabipour ()", "Hans Holtegaard ()", "Camilla Skandarioon ()", "Meliha Saglanmak ()", "Lasse Kramh\u00f8ft ()", "Karin Jagd ()", "Peder Dalgaard ()", "Adam Murkbaoui ()", "Th\u00f8ger Heinesen Kirk ()", "Lado Hadzic ()", "Szhirley ()", "Jacob Riising ()", "Line Skytte ()", "Kim Leprevost ()", "Victor Marcussen ()", "Meinhard St. John ()", "Lars Topp Thomsen ()", "Katrine Tersgov ()", "Torkild Lohdal ()", "Hans B\u00fclow Ungfelt ()", "Kim Loan Thach ()", "Aviaaja Jensen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
