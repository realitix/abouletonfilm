It shows his attempts to cope with a changing world which seems to have no place for him. He has no consciousness of any kind but is always on the verge of turning into a more coherent human being, only to be slapped down. It begins with the hero's childhood. Then comes the first love marred by his unwilling involvement in fascict politics, him being taken for a Jew because of his nose. Later he decides to join the army to charm the girl, but arrives too late for any fighting. He is arrested by entering German troops while he dresses in officer's uniform and mistakenly sent to POW camp as an officer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ledMwPZhHPwoboJyB2h1RQZfSFV.jpg", "actors": ["Bogumi\u0142 Kobiela (Jan Piszczyk)", "Maria Ciesielska (Basia)", "Helena Dabrowska (Biuralistka Wych\u00f3wna)", "Barbara Lass (Jola)", "Wojciech Siemion (Personalny J\u00f3zef Kacperski)", "Adam Pawlikowski (Podchor\u0105\u017cy Osewski)", "Adam Pawlikowski (Jelonek)", "Tadeusz Janczar (Podchor\u0105\u017cy Sawicki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [204196, 36402, 93540, 151545], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
