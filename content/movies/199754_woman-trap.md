The revelation that Dan's own brother Ray (Chester Morris) is the secret head of all local criminal activities does not weaken Dan's resolve in the least. The barely relevant title is a reference to \"heroine\" Kitty Evans (Evelyn Brent), the wife of a minor gang functionary. Screenwriter Joseph L. Mankiewicz, presumably on a dare, makes a brief appearance as a crime reporter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iKBgiydCtGw5n2KeuZV7SVbHGCe.jpg", "actors": ["Hal Skelly (Dan Malone)", "Chester Morris (Ray Malone)", "Evelyn Brent (Kitty Evans)", "William B.
