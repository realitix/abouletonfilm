When he stumbles across a crayon-scribbled \u201cmissing child\u201d poster with a scrawled telephone number and the words \u201cHLEPP ME?\u201d written on it, he figures it to be harmless\u2013and deciding to base a story around it, he calls the number. This leads to an encounter with Bryant (Goodloe Byron) who flatly claims to have actually kidnapped a girl, stating she will be released only if Steven pays a mere $2000 ransom within two weeks. Steven initially dismisses Bryant as a morbid prankster\u2014until Bryant begins a relationship with his only friend, Rene (Helen Bonaparte) and starts popping up in his life in apparently coincidental, yet increasingly invasive and unsettling ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jhf6ysdqFLT9qQKMgQALiriyjbS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
