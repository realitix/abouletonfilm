She always sang the truth, sometimes bitter, sometimes funny, sometimes cruel. She was feared, despised and coveted. Taarka sang throughout her remarkable life, throughout her fate, from a small Seto village to international fame. And she sang well. Really well. Taarka became the Mother of the Song, a legend. But as a woman, as a member of the community, the Seto people never really accepted her. Taarka - a despised woman and a worshiped singer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ubuocmhnd48tegSNWTRBuNe0dkR.jpg", "actors": ["Inga Salurand (Young Taarka)", "Siiri Sisask (Darja 'Taarka' Pisumaa)", "Marje Metsur (Old Taarka)", "Riina Maidre (Tatjana)", "Siim Maaten ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
