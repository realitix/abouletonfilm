The locale boasts of open paddy fields, coconut plantations, sacred groves and takes the viewer to the good old bygone era where things were still simpler. Unni is the apple of his mother's eyes (played by Devi Ajith).  After having a great summer vacation, Unni and his friends move to the 6th grade after the new academic year begins. Unni loves his school life mainly because of his crush Riya (played onscreen by Meenakshi). Unni feels threatened by the newcomer in his class - Roney (played by new comer Master Naaif), who happens to be talented in various disciplines of art. Soon they lock horns and are in competition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7NuGbOdvcAE6Pky22fFIueavIEw.jpg", "actors": ["Gourav Menon (Unni)", "Akash Santhosh (Abu)", "Meenakshi (Riya)", "Saiju Kurup (Satheeshan Puzhakkara)", "Krishna Prabha (Molly)", "Anjali Aneesh Upasana (Daisy)", "Prajod Kalabhavan (Sudheer)", "Bineesh Bastin (Rony)", "Devi Ajith ()", "Sohan Seenulal ()", "Dinesh Prabhakar ()", "Amith Chakalakkal ()", "Rony David Raj ()", "Gokulan ()", "Priyanka Anoop ()", "Adish Praveen ()", "Naaif Noushad (Rony)", "Sidharth (Lalu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EiYdQp-VNg8"}
