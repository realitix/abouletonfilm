His voice then merges with that of the street children, like an echo that repeats the same story, like a fatal fate that marks bodies through time. These children forgotten by all, these children who roam the labyrinthine alleys of the markets, who are beggars until adolescence and then become thieves, gang leaders or protectors to a new generation of orphans.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
