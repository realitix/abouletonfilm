Played against the backdrop of social upheaval, the characters in the drama come to epitomize the best and worst of each pole of the political sphere. A 17-year-old hoodlum by the name of Gladow (Ullrich Wesselmann) works hand-in-glove with a local white-collar criminal to rob and pillage every day and night, defying capture. While he and his gang of thugs are terrorizing the people of Berlin, the Soviets are trying to make the blockade of their region of control impermeable. The future casts long shadows over the drama, as Berlin's problems take the shape of times to come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ZgD7vmqqUuikbLbCglIrZboNaO.jpg", "actors": ["Hilmar Thate (Gustav V\u00f6lpel)", "Katharina Thalbach (Lisa Gabler)", "Ulrich Wesselmann (Gladow)", "Ilse Pag\u00e9 (Frau Gerti V\u00f6lpel)", "Karin Baal (Frau Lucie Gladow)", "Peter Brombacher (Sch\u00e4fer)", "Klaus Pohl (Gabler)", "Hanns Zischler (Ridzinski)", "Horst Laube (Herr Gladow)", "J\u00fcrgen Flimm (Westkommissar)", "Kurt Raab (Chauffeur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
