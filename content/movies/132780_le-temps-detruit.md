One of these was the father of the film's director. The two others were Paul Nizan, the writer and Communist, who became disillusioned with Marxism when the Hitler-Stalin pact was signed, and Maurice Jaubert, the composer who wrote the scores for a number of films, including Jean Vigo's \"Zero de Conduit.\"\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aFIg41dJh5mEguqDPdexUwb9FqQ.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Marc Bory (Voice)", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leidgens (Voice)", "Philippe Nahoun (Voice)", "Anne Terrier (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
