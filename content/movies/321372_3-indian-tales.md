Three stories spread over four seasons that sketch a new generation of Indians who are less resigned than their parents, for better and for worse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fSwG5w9vJCPznGrvjtEOR2Sat6P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
