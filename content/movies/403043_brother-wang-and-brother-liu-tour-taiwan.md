One day, they come across a fortune teller who offers a  peculiar forecast: that Wang will become very wealthy in three days but that Liu will die in 44  days. When Wang strikes gold by winning the lottery, just as predicted, the celebratory mood is  soon eclipsed by the reminder that Liu\u2019s death also has been forecast. With his newfound  wealth, Wang decides to reward his dying buddy with the trip of a lifetime. Carrying around a  suitcase full of cash, the working-class twosome embark on a road trip around the beautiful island  of Taiwan.
