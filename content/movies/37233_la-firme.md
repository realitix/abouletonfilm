He and his wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn) are ecstatic in their affluent new world until clues mount up that the firm has a sinister side. Gene Hackman plays his mentor at the firm while Ed Harris appears as an FBI agent. Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn and Gary Busey are also on hand.\r\n\r\nThis has long been one of my favorites from this genre. You really feel for McDeere (Cruise) & his wife as their utopia morphs into an inescapable hell. In the Washington DC scene you grasp how limited their choices are as they\u2019re caught in a crossfire between the Mob and the FBI. McDeere must use his wits, his knowledge and \u201cgolden connections\u201d for them to get out unscathed, if possible. \r\n\r\nI always favored the piano score by Dave Grusin, which some have described as \u201cbouncy.\u201d While you could call it that, it has different tones depending on the sequence. For instance, during the closing city chase it\u2019s driving and portentous. There\u2019s also a melancholic component when suitable. The positive side of the piano score is that it makes the film timeless. Consider quality movies from that general era which were horribly dated by conventional scores, like \u201cNo Way Out\u201d (1987).        \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Memphis, Tennessee; West Memphis, Arkansas; Cayman Islands; Washington DC; Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A/A-"}], "recommandations_id": [9944, 9869, 881, 10731], "youtube_key": "Auxb3l4Y8j0"}
