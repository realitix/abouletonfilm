It was the largest, most comprehensive survey of Koons\u2019s art ever assembled, spanning four decades of his career and displaying 145 works from every series, including 13 new pieces exhibited publicly for the first time.  The film follows Koons and Whitney Chief Curator, Scott Rothkopf, who conceived and organized the show, through every gallery of the exhibition. In addition, insightful interviews with Adam Weinberg, the Whitney\u2019s Director, Robert Storr, Dean Emeritus of the Yale School of Art, and Michelle Kuo, Editor of Artforum, help to deepen the investigation into Koon\u2019s art and process.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jeff Koons (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "D1OSOMbiVpQ"}
