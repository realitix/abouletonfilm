On the day of his university entrance ceremony, Makoto meets a fresh-faced, quirky girl named Shizuru. Makoto has a complex which causes him to shy away from contact with other people, but she succeeds in getting him to open up to her naturally. All Shizuru wants is to be with Makoto, so she takes up a camera too. The two spend their days together taking photos in the forest behind the campus. However, Makoto has feelings for another student named Miyuki. Shizuru decides that if Makoto likes Miyuki, she wants to like her too. She wants to like everything that he does. One day, she tells Makoto that she wants to take a photo of them kissing in the forest as a present for 'her birthday'. He obliges for her sake, and they kiss in the forest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t3qjXkRMgJ1gSFeVueDksmDvVVg.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroshi Tamaki (Makoto Segawa)", "Aoi Miyazaki (Shizuru Satonaka)", "Meisa Kuroki (Miyuki Toyama)", "Munetaka Aoki (Ryo Shirohama)", "Keisuke Koide (Kyohei Sekiguchi)", "Y\u00fbya Ogawa ()", "Asae Oonishi (Yuka Yaguchi)", "Misa Uehara (Saki Inoue)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [106973, 66044, 123615, 113211], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
