Spyros is driven for his sake by separation from his spoiled and wealthy fianc\u00e9, Katerina, and the usual problems in such cases begin. In the pre-existing class differences, the hatred of the people in his circle, who do everything they can to prevent it, is added. Spyros, however, is totally determined to cope with life the way he thinks - and eventually succeeds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eqNtlr1NjaRnG6yyIdvGfTCPasO.jpg", "actors": ["Eleni Anousaki (Eleni)", "Kostas Karras (Spyros)", "Anestis Vlahos (Petros)", "Lavrentis Dianellos ()", "Petros Pantazis ()", "Gina Voulgari (Katerina)", "Alekos Anastasiadis ()", "Alekos Daropoulos ()", "Spyros Kabanis ()", "Aggelos Mavropoulos ()", "Yorgos Liarakos ()", "Despoina Stylianopoulou ()", "Yorgos Moutsios ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
