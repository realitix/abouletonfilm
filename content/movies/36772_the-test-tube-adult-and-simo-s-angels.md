He is then cloned into a test-tube adult (a play on the phrase test-tube child) named Richard Ilyevitch Jyr\u00e4 by his creator (father and mother) Dr. Jyr\u00e4 (his name is intended to appeal to both American and Soviet sensibilities). Loiri and Ahonen play the roles of gangster attempting to kidnap Jyr\u00e4 and/or Mutikainen, thinking they are the same person. Both would reprise their roles for 1980's Tup-akka-lakko. Additionally Loiri portrays a slew of characters such as a drunk hockey-fan attempting to get to Moscow and making a guest-appearance as Uuno Turhapuro at the end. Simo Salminen once more plays a character named after himself who is the head of a detective agency called Simon Enkelit (an obvious take on Charlie's Angels).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a7RSwmSHQCPpbVBGxDcjQ1aCfqj.jpg", "actors": ["Spede Pasanen (Matemmatikko Mauno Mutikainen)", "Vesa-Matti Loiri ()", "Simo Salminen (Simo Seiv\u00e4st\u00f6)", "Tapio H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (Tohtori Jaakko Jyr\u00e4)", "Olavi Ahonen (Teuvo Tasanen, gangsteri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [223192, 88126, 211233, 38821], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
