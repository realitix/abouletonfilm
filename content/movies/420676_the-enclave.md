Partly inspired by Joseph Conrad\u2019s modernist literary masterpiece Heart of Darkness, the visceral and moving work was filmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo using 16mm colour infra-red film, which captures otherwise invisible parts of the spectrum. The resulting imagery in Mosse\u2019s work is hallucinatory and dream-like with the usual greens of jungle and forest replaced by shimmering violet. The Enclave depicts a complicated, strife-ridden place in a way that reflects its complexity, using a strategy of beauty and transfixion to combat the wider invisibility of a conflict that has claimed so many.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wJMBa2XHuvEhqVz5Qen6FmmYJqp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
