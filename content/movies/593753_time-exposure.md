The photograph, taken at night, features an empty street in Philadelphia. Street lamps glow, light subtly reflected in the asphalt below. As Guzzetti traces the origins of the image, a tender portrait of his father comes into focus. What was and what could have been are inexplicably entwined in one static shot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hGzvFdHfc6oGJJnTmLoZE64Nt5O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
