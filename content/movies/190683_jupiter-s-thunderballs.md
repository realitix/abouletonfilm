They fizzle. Hephaestus tries to make some repairs but succeeds only in heating the bolts and burning Zeus's hands. Zeus conjures nine muses, but do their incantations help? He dismisses them as well as a visiting Pan, and his fits of pique become counter-productive. Can he get his powers back?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rVbNd1Mzv69wOvOm91gZnV4dL1l.jpg", "actors": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [195954, 108285, 195951, 190690], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
