In this version of the disappearance of Ambrose Small, the setting has been changed from Toronto, 1919, to Chicago of the same year. Gorgeous cinematography in mostly black and white underscores the racial tensions of the time, while intentional anachronisms and Calgary-raised director Daniel Nearing\u2019s postmodern vision give the film an otherworldly quality.  While the investigation of Small\u2019s case is a central device, Nearing\u2019s real objective is to expose the characters of the time and stoke the flames of mystery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lHuJy4Cg0lywBrw4LIdW19Ky8gb.jpg", "actors": ["Herman Wilkins (Deandre Son Carter)", "Diandra Lyle (Nia Coleman)", "Joe Mack (John Doughty)", "Dianne Bischoff (Theresa Greenaway)", "McKenzie Chinn (Aaliyah Carter)", "Jay Disney (Ambrose Greenaway)", "Joyce Porter (Courtroom Gallery Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
