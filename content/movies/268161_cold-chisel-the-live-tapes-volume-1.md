There is no better way to commemorate and preserve this period of time by releasing The Live Tapes Vol. 1: Live At The Hordern Pavilion. Hard to believe it\u2019s the first live release since Ringside 10 years ago. Two CDs and a DVD (or BluRay) makes for an awesome package with all the hits such as Flame Trees, Khe Sanh, Cheap Wine and Choir Girl, plus a taster of newer material also.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wZ1AznbdDNWcrjlZIi0D3GwNtno.jpg", "actors": ["Jimmy Barnes (Himself)", "Donisha Walker (Himself)", "Ian Moss (Himself)", "Phillips Smalley (Himself)", "Charley Drayton (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
