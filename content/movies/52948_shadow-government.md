He has no idea that he's being watched, tracked and studied. Is he a threat to national security? Is he a terrorist or a criminal? No, he's an ordinary American citizen. Like everyone else, John's rights and freedoms have been systematically destroyed - all in the name of security and convenience. Is it about peace and unity? Or is it about ultimate global power? What if there were hidden forces with no ties to democracy or constitutional rights in power? What if new laws, media propaganda and Secret Societies labeled John a danger to society? And what if all this set the stage for a Biblically prophesied global government run by the Antichrist?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aDk9phjtaT350wp1kFZweXH6acr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
