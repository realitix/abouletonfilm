Throughout his long career, Miles utilized the best in contemporary pop music, and this time he had some uniquely suitable sources; Cyndi Lauper's hit \"Time After Time\" and Michael Jackson's \"Human Nature.\" Combine funk, pop, and the founder of the Birth of the Cool, the result is an elegant restrained restatement of everything Miles Davis. Add in the virtuoso guitarist John Scofield - and the result is a musical treasure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zmql2IT0OmM5VZiLFjNkwA7DMCL.jpg", "actors": ["Miles Davis (Trumpeter)", "Bob Berg (Sax Player)", "Robert Irving III (Synthesizer Player)", "Daryl Jones (Bass Player)", "John Scofield (Guitar Player)", "Steve Thornton (Percussionist)", "Vince Wilburn Jr. (Drummer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
