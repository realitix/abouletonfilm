Not really depicting his entire life and loves, much of this is fictionalized scatology. Although not without basis in fact, Mozart has attained a somewhat colorful reputation and this is really just more of the same. The music is a joy, but the movie bogs down in titillation. Mozart's last days were lived in poverty and disgrace--stemming chiefly from his embracing of the Freemason stance, which was essentially a heresy in Austria and the rest of Europe at that time. None of this is depicted and even a satyr could not sustain the lifestyle Mozart has been portrayed as having here. Still, this is an interesting movie and worth a listen to.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Adq0GWjyyQVl0HqVVLtnfhHZ9Dt.jpg", "actors": ["Oskar Werner (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)", "Johanna Matz (Annie Gottlieb)", "Gertrud K\u00fcckelmann (Constanze Mozart geb.
