Emerging from her youth crippled with arthritis, Lewis escaped into her painting at the age of 30. She had never seen a work of art and had never attended an art class but her paintings captured the simple strength, beauty and happiness of the world she saw - a world without shadows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xJQcF7CPfIqQFXjl9QzNhnnr21j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
