The island gets some visitors in the form of a teenage boy band, \"the Wild Ones\", and their gang of swimsuit-clad young people, who head there in a crowded powerboat ostensibly for a scavenger hunt. However, they spend about half their screen time crooning to each other, or dancing on the beach.  The island's owner, Wellington  recruits his blonde  daughter, Junior , to remove the teenagers from the island. Junior is eager to see her love interest, rotund toupee-wearing botanist Irving . However, Irving is more interested in flowers and his bicycle than in the amorous Junior. Wellington asks Irving to spy on the teenagers, which he does by donning a sweatshirt that reads \"Fink University\", and \"getting their trust\" by joining them in dancing the Turtle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/beWwjMOrGYqMgwm1M3ZGz1EukWw.jpg", "actors": ["Jayne Mansfield (Junior Wellington)", "Phyllis Diller (Camille Salamander)", "Brian Donlevy (George Wellington)", "Harriet Hilliard (Punjab, The Sikh)", "Jack E.
