His business partners are taken into custody and the authorities have a few questions for him to answer. Rather than wait around, he decides to take off to Moravia with his wife and two children. In the process, he pretends that everything is normal, rediscovers the value of family life, meets up with a former colleague lost in provincial obscurity, and becomes the object of a manhunt. Libor is not a criminal type, merely someone who signs cheques and is drawn into a business world failing to recognise its own criminality (he doesn\u2019t even flee the country).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pUHqNnJTsSEJgStf6NIVxucfcdK.jpg", "actors": ["Igor Chmela (Libor Pokorn\u00fd)", "Eva Vrbkov\u00e1 (Iva Pokorn\u00e1)", "Martin Finger (vy\u0161et\u0159ovatel)", "Albert Mik\u0161\u00edk (Luk\u00e1\u0161 Pokorn\u00fd)", "Krist\u00fdna Tom\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 (T\u00edna Pokorn\u00e1)", "Monika A.
