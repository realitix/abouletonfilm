Each reel consists of over 3,500 images with mathematically planned sections, improvised cross rhythms, variations in colour, density, tree species and shape, with sequences following the Fibonacci series (Kren\u2019s \u2018Golden Section of film\u2019) and countered with staggered 2:3; 4:3 rhythms. Part scored, part random and rough edged echoing the Japanese musical phenomenon. \"wind in the trees\"\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hTc4tjAS6uQ4ugxhgLLVcoMJDrY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
