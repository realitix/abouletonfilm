With them he develops an intimate and poetic film, consisting of portraits of friends, walks through Barcelona and a trip to his native country, Venezuela, where chaos imposes its aesthetic appeal. A complex and fragmented film that shows the world of the filmmaker that sometimes happens to be as absurd and miraculous as a painting by Hieronymus Bosch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gMbkESgb5KliUFjeG0JHdBBMbRH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
