A camera trained on the theater's front doors shows a crowd exiting. Most patrons are well dressed: some women carry muffs, almost all wear hats, some are elaborate; the men are in suits, as are many of the boys. All are white. Occasionally, the camera pans up to the marquee. The same people exit more than once; a woman pushing a baby carriage exits twice, By the end, the crowd is more animated, moving more quickly, smiling more. A final shot shows the whole theater in the frame, a crowd in front, a restaurant above.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
