Richard was born with a complex disability. He needs 24-hour care, seven days a week. Now in her early sixties, his mother Deirdre is apprehensive about her son's future. She is determined to build a circle of friends and carers for Richard, and to find him sustainable long-term accommodation. Wiseman's intimate documentary, enriched by Deirdre's impassioned voice, reveals just what it means to care for someone who needs care for life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vHYtON36hS98HRq9Yww1ZbsK285.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
