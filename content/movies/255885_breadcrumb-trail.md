It includes footage going back to the early 1990s that I shot when repeatedly driving up from Athens, GA to Louisville to try to chase rumors of what they guys were up to. Over the years I tracked down more stories about them, then began filming interviews with each of the band members and their contemporaries. We also unearthed some unseen/uncirculated footage from their few live performances as well as the writing and arranging of Spiderland.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2w1pMHcNqolH8SE4L8tqDrnqrQy.jpg", "actors": ["Brian McMahan (Himself)", "David Pajo (Himself)", "Britt Walford (Himself)", "Ethan Buckler (Himself)", "Todd Brashear (Himself)", "James Murphy (Himself)", "Steve Albini (Himself)", "David Yow (Himself)", "Ian MacKaye (Himself)", "Matt Sweeney (Himself)", "Will Oldham (Himself [archival])"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [1666], "youtube_key": "LVdU_bLD2-M"}
