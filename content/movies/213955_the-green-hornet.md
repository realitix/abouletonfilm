The bulk of the film consists of four episodes crudely spliced together. Scattered throughout are bizarrely irrelevant fight scenes from other episodes, which make the already disjointed plotting quite surreal. The television image was cropped to make a widescreen film, which means the tops of heads and hats are lopped off the frame with alarming regularity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rqQfnf7SLBiSqFciB5DnusmfDhq.jpg", "actors": ["Van Williams (Britt Reid / The Green Hornet)", "Bruce Lee (Kato)", "Charles Bateman (Quentin Crane)", "Geoffrey Horne (Peter Eden)", "Mako (Low Sing)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [226343, 203531, 85761, 194246], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
