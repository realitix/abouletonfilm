The rebels of the LRA ( Lord's Resistance Army) are waging a bloody guerilla campaign. They abduct children and conscript them as soldiers, forcing them to kill their own people. The film Lost Children documents the lives of four children, from 8 to 14 years old, who successfully escaped the LRA. They return home to be branded as killers.  Will they ever forget? Will they be forgiven? Can you ever be a child again after being a soldier?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xFcAcCFGBbIMm8EKcEfPFi0E1XO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "WxHo07aAmck"}
