This documentary covers the crew as they get interviewed, from a behind the scenes angle, with little to no restraint. They praise 'Little Man' and 'White Chick' without being sarcastic, act incredibly homoerotic (and that's putting it politely), visit famous film and historical sites, get taped as they urinate and play in the toilet, and generally act like buffoons as they tour their little film around theaters for nearly a month. A very thorough, oddball doc.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wDeUp5Wd3ve52BHvDUq9qYqdSCG.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Pegg ()", "Edgar Wright ()", "Nick Frost ()", "Joe Cornish ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
