It's time to leave for the party and Julia discovers she has more than a carful, so the boys volunteer to get in the boot. When Dana refuses drive Julia takes the keys, and their fun night out takes a tragic turn. Mixing drama and gross-out comedy, BOOT shows how a good time can inexorably slide into tragedy; how sacrifice can seem like a betrayal; and how guilt is the heaviest burden to bear.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Diane Kaye Alde (Zoe)", "Lucy Coleman (Julia)", "Shaun Robert Foley (Mike)", "Sam Glissan (Dave)", "Kathy Hoang (Katie)", "Adam Marks (Gavin)", "Adam Roberts (Darren)", "Meegan Warner (Dana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
