It is a metaphor for her life. Her mother Marie had her when she was only 16 and now wants little to do with her. She spends most of her nights out on the town. Rosine hungers for her mother's love. She is almost obsessed with getting it. She is frustrated because she never does. One day Pierre, her father shows up from the blue and Mare gladly takes him in. Rosine is a good sport and likes that he takes an interest in her. The brief respite from gloom doesn't last as Pierre soon begins to beat Marie and eventually rapes Rosine. The traumatized girl tries to get her mother to admit the incident, to pay attention to the hurting child, but Marie just doesn't care. Marie has no choice but to run away from home and make her own way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/RQ6WYLH7M6IgwFJvd1JQ6TX2kx.jpg", "actors": ["Elo\u00efse Charretier (Rosine)", "Mathilde Seigner (Marie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
