The long black phases between the sequences are as important as the images themselves because they leave empty space where the \"echo\" of the last image can seep through without interfering with the following image. But our logical mind still somehow feels compelled to construe some kind of sense, parallel, or some erratic story out of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AnuPqaksNX6oaaRkqTW3Yf2DVwY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [130872, 200905, 111793, 178535], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
