WHERE DO WE GO reveals itself to be a synesthetic experiment rendering sight as rhythmical and the visual edit as musical. The filmmaker painstakingly animates brief phases of movement recorded with a Lomography Supersampler* to create a visual series of trains, tracks, bridges and nature that are re-constellated and brought together in a multiple split-screen projection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tkqmc1TXWjla4TsTv9PIPBTfC5O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "244694446"}
