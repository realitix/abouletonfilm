Shot in Israel during the final days of the Yom Kippur War. Promised Lands is less straight documentary than visual collage. There are images of combat zones and soldiers, but also everyday street life, desert landscapes, funerals, supermarkets, the Wailing Wall. The soundtrack is snatches of radio, bursts of church bells and gunfire, and an extended voiceover from two politically opposed Israeli thinkers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kJj2nCq01xgm6w0xjbWaHh4Ryhx.jpg", "actors": ["Susan Sontag ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4NnHLJkcxrE"}
