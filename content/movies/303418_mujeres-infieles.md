Three segments, I liked the first one, but not the other two. The first had a very good ending, the second was 'weird' in lack of a better word, and the third was a little violent, I didn't expect it from a movie talking about 'cheating on'. This is of course, my humble personal opinion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jxTvanz8myuEZKmc71DJgIDnBSK.jpg", "actors": ["Enrique Rocha (Armando)", "Jos\u00e9 Alonso (Rafael)", "Lina Santos (Julieta)", "Hugo Stiglitz (Eduardo)", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez (Marcelo)", "Ra\u00fal Araiza (Ricardo)", "Rafael Rojas (Alfonzo)", "Michelle Mayer ()", "Elizabeth Katz (Mariana)", "Juan Carlos Colombo (Psiquiatra)", "Claudia Vega (Clara)", "Sergio S\u00e1nchez ()", "Zoraida G\u00f3mez (Cristina)", "Mar\u00eda Moreno ()", "Memo Mu\u00f1oz ()", "Tatiana Woolrich ()", "Guadalupe Bola\u00f1os (Vicky)", "Laura Baque ()", "Sara Monar ()", "Gerardo S\u00e1nchez ()", "Patricia Bola\u00f1os ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
