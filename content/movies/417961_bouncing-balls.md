Shot in extreme close-up, the work is perhaps an ironic reference to an earlier film Bouncing Two Balls Between the Floor and Ceiling with Changing Rhythms, in which he bounced rubber balls. Along with Black Balls, Gauze, and Pulling Mouth, Bouncing Balls is one of Nauman's \"Slo-Mo\" films which are shot with an industrial high speed camera.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bruce Nauman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
