These paintings count among the world\u2019s favourites. Renoir, however, grew tired of this style and changed course. This film, based on the collection of 181 Renoirs at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia,\u2013 examines the direction he then took and why it provokes such extreme reactions right up to today. Some claim they are repulsed by Renoir\u2019s later works and some claim they are seduced. What may surprise many is that among the many artists who sought Renoir\u2019s new works out and were clearly highly influenced by them were the two giants of the 20th century \u2013 Picasso and Matisse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9WlaPv0KMAD2Cb7AYgtYTL1b0IB.jpg", "actors": ["Yves Aubert (Renoir)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UeirVwJ6PSM"}
