Complacent is a portrait of the middle American lifestyle. The 9 to 5 at a desk job, cookie-cutter homes with manicured lawns, golf three times a week, Florida vacation each year with the family. Only problem.... No one loves the other.... No one strives for more.... No one sees outside his or her own front yard.... They just coast... Question is, can you really go through life like this without deteriorating from the inside? Myah decides that you can't, you have to do more, want more, care more and it sets off a chain of events within the group of friends that is at times amusing and at times heartbreaking, but eventually fatal in both reality and metaphor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/we31PabKN4hXC60I1rXeaIQwdf9.jpg", "actors": ["Cerina Vincent (Myah Sanderson)", "Kerri Green (Beth Wilkensen)", "Joey Kern (Robert Wilkensen)", "Keir O'Donnell (Thomas Pulchek)", "Elisa Donovan (Jennifer Pulchek)", "Michael Worth (Eugene York)", "Christopher Showerman (Jason Haney)", "Melanie Monroe (Morgan Haney)", "Adrienne Barbeau (Judy Sanderson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
