But that s not the only thing that makes Pingo unique. He also happens to be raised by a most unlikely duo, Lou and Buddy, two birds of prey who initially set out to make a meal out of Pingo and end up taking him in as their own. Pingos toe tapping skills not only catch the eye of a darling young female penguin, Bella, but they could be the key to stopping the vile hermit crab, Gabby, and his dimwitted sea lion sidekick, Thrasher, from destroying a colony of penguins that are home to Pingos long lost parents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eLFGUIi8AbzuxE7yE6keEJz9MFM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
