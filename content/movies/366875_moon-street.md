From that analogy comes 'Moon Street'. While to the spaceships the moon works as reference, in Porto Alegre some cosmonauts find their north on Garibaldi street. Taking over professor's Edward Nkoloso dream and his Zambian space program, this documentary tries to bring the moon and the street together, claiming for a democratic space (urban and cosmic), away from the domain of powerful countries and avenues. How do the urban cosmonauts perceive the stars? The dispute? The dream? Neither USA, or Soviet Union, we searched for space through the free eyes of the forgotten, and many times invisible , street astronauts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Aig8L9aBLsecIjpbslaBsB8S17P.jpg", "actors": ["Alexandre Gon\u00e7alves Dias (himself)", "Ricardo Pires (himself)", "Get\u00falio Mello (himself)", "Emerson da Silva (himself)", "Ana L\u00facia de Medeiros (herself)", "Dominyk Gon\u00e7alves (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kash5VkAKkk"}
