He carries with him a suicide note dedicated to his only friend, who is also an invisible man. An eager young reporter tracks down Takemitsu Nanjo, a war veteran who makes his living visibly, painting his face like a clown's and carrying advertising signs. His favorite neighbor is a little blind girl whose mother is running afoul of local gangsters. The gangsters have been terrorizing the city as \"the invisible gang,\" wrapping themselves up in scarves and trenchcoats so as to be visible to their victims, even though they are supposed to be invisible underneath. Once they discover Nanjo, who is defending his only friends, they beat him and leave him for dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/104lxKglckFTuDKLKBImxtQ87jD.jpg", "actors": ["Seizabur\u00f4 Kawazu (Takamitsu Nanj\u00f4, the Invisible Man)", "Miki Sanjo (Michiyo ,The Singer)", "Minoru Takada (Yajima , Gang boss)", "Yoshio Tsuchiya (Reporter Komatsu)", "Sonosuke Sawamura (Nomura , Dietman)", "Keiko Kondo (Mariko, the little girl)", "Kamatari Fujiwara (Mariko's grandfather)", "Sh\u00f4ichi Hirose (Policeman)", "Fuyuki Murakami (Chief Editor Yamada)", "Akira Sera (The man at street stand)", "Shin \u00d4tomo (Detective)", "Haruo Nakajima (Invisible Man Who was Run Over)", "Kazuo Suzuki (Man in nightclub)", "Y\u00f4 Shiomi ()", "Seijir\u00f4 Onda (Chief of Metropolitan Police)", "Noriko Shigeyama (Dancer in the Nightclub)", "Fumindo Matsuo ()", "Yutaka Nakayama ()", "Shin Yoshida ()", "Sanpei Mine ()", "Haruo Suzuki (Man in Nightclub)", "Masatoshi Takase ()", "Masao Mizuno (Joe)", "Shir\u00f4 Tsuchiya ()", "Mitsuo Tsuda ()", "Akira Kitch\u00f4ji ()", "Yutaka Oka (TV Announcer)", "Takuz\u00f4 Kumagai (\u00d4tsuka)", "Keiichir\u00f4 Katsumoto ()", "Minoru It\u00f4 (Man in Car - Traffic Accident)", "Keiji Sakakida ()", "Shizuko Azuma ()", "Kyoko Mori (Woman in Car Traffic Accident)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
