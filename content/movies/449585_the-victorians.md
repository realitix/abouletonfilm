One is fighting his homosexuality and love for a sadist, the other succumbing to his love for a prostitute. Their moral battles act as the fuel for their thievery, leaving Amsterdam's tourists dry in their path of self destruction. We meet Joey, their naive American victim whose vulnerability leaves him prey to the sadist's sexual games and introduces him to the Amsterdam underground homosexual liberation. It's lust, addiction, deceit, and everything in between. It's the royal rogues of Amsterdam.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1pfI0dgVkRWmuV7VNwPDrki675r.jpg", "actors": ["Ali Rodney (Faith)", "Stephen Underwood (Danny)", "Samuel White (Rey)", "Jordan Maycock (Abba)", "Libby James Watt (Joey's Mom (voice))", "Neil Webster (Alfi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Iwj2M38UKZM"}
