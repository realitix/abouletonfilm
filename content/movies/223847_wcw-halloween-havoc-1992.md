The main event was Jake Roberts versus Sting in a Coal Miner's Glove match. A second main event was a title defense of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship by Ron Simmons against The Barbarian. Steve Williams and Terry Gordy were to challenge the NWA &amp; WCW Wold Tag Team Champions, Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes, however Gordy no-showed the event which led to Steve Austin subbing for him. Another substitution occured when Rick Rude chose not to wrestle twice and defend his WCW US Heavyweight Championship. This led to Big Van Vader defending Rude's title against Nikita Koloff.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kSiU91OQ3C0zwE7q7JQpEQ0BCUI.jpg", "actors": ["Aurelian Jake Smith Jr. (Himself)", "Steve Borden (Sting)", "Ron Simmons (Himself)", "Sione Vailahi (The Barbarian)", "Mick Foley (Cactus Jack)", "Theodore Long (Teddy Long)", "Richard Erwin Rood (Rick Rude)", "Masahiro Ch\u00f4no (Himself)", "Harley Race (Himself)", "Kensuke Sasaki (Himself)", "Barry Clinton Windham (Himself)", "Dustin Runnels (Dustin Rhodes)", "Steven Williams (Himself)", "Steve Austin (Himself)", "Leon Allen White (Big Van Vader)", "Nelson Scott Simpson (Nikita Koloff)", "Richard Henry Blood Sr. (Ricky Steamboat)", "Brian Pillman (Himself)", "Tom Zenk (Himself)", "Tom Brandi (Johnny Gunn)", "Troy Martin (Shane Douglas)", "Martin Lunde (Arn Anderson)", "Michael Seitz (Michael Hayes)", "Robert Lee Eaton (Bobby Eaton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
