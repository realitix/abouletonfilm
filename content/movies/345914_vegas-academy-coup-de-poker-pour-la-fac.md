Despite not the best film, still fun to watch. But the thing is it is not a big screen film. I mean for todays world, watching this kind in cinemas, totally useless. On the weekends, watching it with a bunch of friends on the streaming platform or television would do better.\r\n\r\nThe story was much better than I anticipated. It was about the parents who lost their daughter's college scholarship, now wants an alternative solution, so they decide to go illegal. I mean gamble and then they make one, a gambling house. The consequence of it haunts them and what happens later is the film's end.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay writer's directional debut. The cast was just good. The runtime was even better, less than 90 minutes. So there's no drag, except a few unavoidable cliches in such comedy. Jeremy Renner's cameo was good. Overall, watch and forget kind film. But the idea looked nice, so I won't be surprised if they make a sequel to it. If a crappy comedy like 'Neighbors' makes one, then why not this! But I'm not in favour, unless they come up with a better storyline.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [345922, 417644, 373569, 419680], "youtube_key": "f-SP8iSCbKM"}
