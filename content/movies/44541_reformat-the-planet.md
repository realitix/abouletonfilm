Familiar devices such as the Nintendo Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System are pushed in new directions with startling results. Using New York as a microcosm for a larger global movement, 'Reformat the Planet' maps out the genesis of the first annual Blip Festival, a four day celebration of over 30 international artists exploring the untapped potential of low-bit video game consoles. With floor-stomping rhythms and fist-waving melodies, trailblazers of the ChipTune idiom descend upon Manhattan to pen a new chapter in the history of electronic music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aNJ4CcWaYn4Ms4L8JwaoJs24JaK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
