Each of the three films was evenly divided into two half-hour \"episodes,\" and each starred Hugh Beaumont as San Francisco-based amateur sleuth Dennis O'Brien. In Pier 23, O'Brien first tackles the case of a wrestler who has died of a suspicious heart attack after refusing to lose a match. He then agrees to help a priest talk an escaped criminal into returning to prison. The film's two-part structure leads to repetition and predictability, but it's fun to watch TV's \"Ward Cleaver\" making like Philip Marlowe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zro8sci6Ap4BqJWjsLI6IZ3jxoA.jpg", "actors": ["Hugh Beaumont (Dennis O'Brien)", "Ann Savage (Ann Harmon)", "Edward Brophy (Prof. Shicker)", "Mike Mazurki (Ape Danowski)", "Richard Travis (Police Inspector Lt.
