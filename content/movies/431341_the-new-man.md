Fiction director Josh Appignanesi turns the camera on himself and his wife as they undergo the ordeal of becoming parents in the era of man-children and assisted reproduction. Faced with fatherhood, Josh spirals comically into an envious career funk. But life-threatening complications emerge- the couple are tested to the brink, confronting shattering losses. It's a portrait of our generation going through a revolution in reproduction- forced to find new ways to think about ourselves as creative beings. We hear from Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, John Berger, Darian Leader (20,000 Days) and Zadie Smith. Universal yet still taboo, it's a film for everyone who has children, wants them, or still feels like a child themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dasbfwZllIgZATm6md9QCPqkZMW.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Andrusier (Himself)", "Lisa Appignanesi (Herself)", "Richard Appignanesi (Himself)", "Chloe Aridjis (Herself)", "Geoffrey Baum (Himself)", "Josh Baum (Himself)", "Shirley Baum (Herself)", "John Berger (Himself)", "Anna Colton (Herself)", "Sophie Fiennes (Herself)", "Katrina Forrester (Herself)", "Antony Gormley (Himself)", "Mark Greenfield (Himself)", "Hannah Kuper (Herself)", "Nick Laird (Himself)", "Nikita Lalwani (Herself)", "Darian Leader (Himself)", "Yoni Magid (Himself)", "Hisham Matar (Himself)", "Simon McBurney (Himself)", "Adam Rosenthal (Himself)", "Renata Salecl (Herself)", "David Schneider (Himself)", "Poppy Sebag-Montefiore (Herself)", "Danny Shine (Himself)", "Tom Shkolnik (Himself)", "Zadie Smith (Herself)", "Slavoj \u017di\u017eek (Himself)", "Devorah Baum (Herself)", "Josh Appignanesi (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KwLVE_c7UbI"}
