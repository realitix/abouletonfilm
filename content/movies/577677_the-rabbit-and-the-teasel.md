Fiction and autobiographical elements mingle in a lyrical tale that drags the viewer into a universe of beauty, death, and decay. Author and director Els Dietvorst zooms in on the raw reality of a rainy year that drives the farmer to despair. In a timeless setting on the Irish countryside, a contemporary parable unfolds, as enchanting as it is confronting.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Liam Heffernan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
