I divided the original film into scenes (like I did with \"Faces\") and then replaced each scene with one shot filmed at the original location (unlike \"Faces\" where shots were gleaned from the original film itself). My \"Easy Rider\" tries to find today\u2019s counter-culture (if one exists) by replacing the 60\u2019s music with music that I listen to today.' ~ James Benning", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/83B2SyD1k28DNJ38N1r7yxbtIGM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
