Thirty-five years later, the men who serviced the aeroplanes are still meeting up for their annual dinner. Now settled into civilian jobs - dentist, baker, taxi-driver, insurance salesman - and with children and grandchildren, they bemoan the decay of traditional Japanese values. Hard liquor is imbibed, toasts raised to the memory of the heroic dead, and old rivalries resurface. The survivors' dissatisfaction with post-war life comes to a head when, in a moment of drunken inspiration, Tokkotai the airline pilot decides on a symbolic gesture to show that the kamikaze spirit lives on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQAQofnaX4gM5CW7H2VxZP2QKxV.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Sallis (Shushin)", "John Blythe (Kamiwashi)", "Harold Goodwin (Shimpu)", "Don Henderson (Tokkotai)", "Richard Vernon (Makato)", "Patricia Prior (Miss Tomishita)", "Mary Maddox (Girl Singer)", "Mark Penfold (Co-Pilot)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
