Born in Cairo, raised in Beirut, he became a star in Rome in the booming Beat scene. He was then imported to Germany, where there was more money to be made. Shayne found himself in Berlin between BRAVO and ZDF Hit Parade, celebrated and exoticized. Stephan Geene, who was 10 years old at the time, was changed forever by this phenomenon, and now explores his fascination.  The encounter with the nervous, rough-edged Ricky Shayne, today 72, survivor of his own star and teen magazine history (the magazine BRAVO alone dedicated two of its celebrity puzzles to him), leads Geene down a variety of paths: including with Shayne\u2019s sons Tarek and Imran, both now the same age as Ricky during his Berlin period and the spitting image of him (at the time).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ricky Shayne ()", "Tarek Shayne Tabet ()", "Imran Shayne Tabet ()", "Kerstin Cmelka ()", "Claudia Basrawi ()", "Stephan Geene ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
