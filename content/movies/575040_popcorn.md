{"tmdb_id": 575040, "title": "Popcorn", "original_title": "Popcorn", "slug_title": "popcorn", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "\"Popcorn\" begins with a teenaged boy reading from an unknown text inside a living room. JoAnn Elam is seen knitting, presumably nearby, before entering the kitchen and proceeding to cook popcorn on the stovetop. Each step is filmed in extreme close-up, with an emphasis on hands and tactility. This attention to process is similar to other films from Elam, notably \" Chocolate Cake \" (F.2011-01-0166). At the end of \"Popcorn,\" following a flurry of light leak and mis-aligned optical printing, the boy happily eats the popped and seasoned kernels. The exact date of production remains unknown.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
