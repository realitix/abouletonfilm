It's not the best, stylish and original zombie movie, but it contains much more gore than **Peter Jackson**'s \"**Dead Alive**\" and to my great surprise, they only used CGI-effects in one scene and that was the last completed kill - It felt like the budget ran out there.\r\n\r\nWhat we have learned from the sequel \"**Mutant Zone**\" is that they flirt a lot with **Peter Jackson** and **Sam Raimi**. And they do so even in this movie, there are also scenes that makes you think of \"**Re-Animator**\". We are going to see various colors of face paint, some latex and lots of colorful fluids what looks like cornflake / oatmeal and food coloring type effects. There's a lot of imagination and the creators made \u200b\u200ban excellent entertainment for all the indie horror lovers out there.\r\n\r\nThis film comes with a bonus disc of \"**Plaga Zombie: Mutant Zone**\". It's obvious to anyone who likes **Dead Alive**, **Evil Dead 2** and **Re-animator** should watch this movie. There are no excuses, so be sure to rent or buy it - It's worth gold!"}], "recommandations_id": [40151, 81841, 15689]}
