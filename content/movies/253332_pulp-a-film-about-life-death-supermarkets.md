Giving a career-best performance exclusive to the film, the band members share their thoughts on fame, love, mortality \u2014 &amp; car maintenance. Director Florian Habicht (Love Story) weaves together the band\u2019s personal offerings with dream-like specially-staged tableaux featuring ordinary people recruited on the streets of Sheffield. Pulp is a music film like no other \u2014 by turns funny, moving, life-affirming &amp; (occasionally) bewildering.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vYzaFZRWaOzomDstDHvb4kOtUBC.jpg", "actors": ["Pulp (Themselves)", "Nick Banks (Himself)", "Candida Doyle (Herself)", "Steve Mackey (Himself)", "Mark Webber (Himself)", "Leo Abrahams (Himself, Guitarist)", "Jean Cook (Herself, Violinist)", "Richard Hawley (Himself, Guitarist)", "The Boxettes (Themselves, Vocals)", "Kate Brown (Herself, Vocals)", "Neo Joshua (Himself, Vocals)", "Yvette Riby-Williams (Herself, Vocals)", "Josephine Cooper (Herself, Pulp Fan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36826, 36046, 24502, 164233], "youtube_key": "uDNz941vRXU"}
