It follows the misadventures of two teenage step brothers (Jack Parry-Jones and Christy O\u2019Donnell) as they head off on a road trip across Scotland, with their relationship challenged by Caitlin (a charismatic Tara Lee), the free spirited and enigmatic girl who comes between them. Cameos from Denis Lawson and Shauna Macdonald and Anton Newcombe\u2019s soundtrack add much to the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3d0JXJa7w4P6aHggd3UrLPF0xg2.jpg", "actors": ["Tara Lee (Caitlin)", "Jack Parry Jones (Michael)", "Christy O'Donnell (Thor)", "Chris Donald (Jim)", "Tam Dean Burn (Davey)", "Tanya Franks (Pam)", "Geoffrey Newland (Jerry)", "Shauna Macdonald (Ruby)", "Niall Greig Fulton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
