They've never really got on, so Midgley wants to be sure he's there if his father ever regains consciousness. As he hates his job as a schoolteacher, and his home-life with his wife, her senile mother and their insolent teenage son, he has no qualms about lingering around the hospital. But as days turn into weeks, his father obstinately refuses to 'slip away', and Denis' motivation for staying by his father's bedside has more and more to do with Valery, a young nurse.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Alan Bennett (Denis Midgley)", "Thora Hird (Aunty Kitty)", "Helen Fraser (Joyce Midgley)", "Julie Walters (Valery)", "David Major (Colin Midgley)", "Elizabeth Spriggs (Alice Duckworth)", "Frank Crompton (Frank Midgley)", "Kirk Wild (Denis as a Boy)", "Alison Lloyd (Denis' Mother)", "Jeanne Doree (Joyce's Mother)", "Derek Fowlds (Hartley)", "Colin Douglas (Uncle Ernest)", "Joan Sanderson (Miss Tunstall)", "Jim Broadbent (Mr Horsfall)", "Aubrey Morris (Headmaster)", "Madge Hindle (Jean)", "Jeremy Mosby (Mark)", "Karen Tunstall (Elizabeth)", "Lucita Lijertwood (Mrs Azakwale)", "Shope Shodeinde (Black Doctor)", "Peter Chelsom (Very Young Doctor)", "Karen Petrie (Heather - Day Nurse)", "Johnny Leeze (Orderly)", "Brenda Hall (Senior Nursing Officer)", "Alan Starkey (Hospital Clerk)", "Alan Hulse (Young Man on Telephone)", "Olive Pendleton (Woman on Telephone)", "Frank Birch (Fat Man)", "Ted Beyer (Teacher)", "Pamela Quinn (1st Nurse)", "Trish Roberts (2nd Nurse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
