The film depicts J. Jordan, a sort of \u201980s Maynard G. Krebs/Rube Goldberg gadget-loving guy who quits his job as a bored and hassled local television news photographer to make a movie about a guy who quits his job to make a movie. Cook describes his film as \u201cthe TV dinner of movies ... it didn\u2019t cost a lot, but it\u2019s still pretty good.\u201d Technically assured and full of heart, laugh-out-loud ambience and humor, and off-the-wall hipness, Cook\u2019s debut will warm the hearts of anyone who has made, or dreams of making, a movie. \u201cA clever comedy, well worth seeing.\u201d\u2014Ted Mahar, The Oregonian. \u201cThe film\u2019s delightful atmosphere wins you over.\u201d\u2014D.K.
