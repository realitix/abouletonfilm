Where the all conquering Russian squad were waiting.\r\n\r\nWe follow Brooks as he assembles a youthful squad then pushes them to the limits, mentally and physically, all while facing pressures in his home life as he gives his all on the ice rinks. If you know your sports history then there's obviously no surprise factor here, but there's good insight into squad dynamics, of coaching and toughness involved in the many facets of high level sport. Russell leads his young cast admirably, while the action scenes during the matches have a kinetic energy that's most impressive. 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [14635, 11652, 13416, 10414], "youtube_key": "X7xfRXGMrDM"}
