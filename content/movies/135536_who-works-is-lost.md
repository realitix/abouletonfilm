The problem is that Bonifacio is a manic-depressive who is morally opposed to working for large firms - even morally opposed to performing any sort of work whatsoever. Bonifacio wanders the streets of Venice, meeting friends and acquaintances, many of them leftist activists. One rebellious friend he can only visit at the local insane asylum, as the stress/futility of activism has shot his nerves. Bonifacio pursues his prankish thoughts, surrealistically remembering his outrageous fascist childhood and his military service, and wistfully recalling his brief but doomed engagement to the winsome Gabriella - doomed only because he can\u2019t face up to any form of responsibility.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mAs6DJsHg9nx2vvGTznLj7ohDcf.jpg", "actors": ["Sady Rebbot (Bonifacio)", "Pascale Audret (Gabriella)", "Tino Buazzelli (Claudio)", "Nando Angelini ()", "Andreina Carli ()", "Gino Cavalieri ()", "Franco Arcalli (Kim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
