Like preachers and jazz solos, freestyles exist only in the moment, a modern-day incarnation of the African-American storytelling tradition. Shot over a period of more than seven years, it is already an underground cult film in the hip-hop world. The film systematically debunks the false image put out by record companies that hip-hop culture is violent or money-obsessed. Instead, it lets real hip-hop artists, known and unknown, weave their story out of a passionate mix of language, politics, and spirituality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t9CoxAseB4Z2ycHqBA6TZVTTyE6.jpg", "actors": ["Muhammad Ali (Himself)", "Planet Asia (Himself)", "Bahamadia (Herself)", "Akim Funk Buddah (Himself)", "Eluard Burt (Himself)", "Myo Campbell (Himself)", "John Coltrane (Himself)", "Darkleaf (Himself)", "Yasiin Bey (Himself)", "Kirby Dominant (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
