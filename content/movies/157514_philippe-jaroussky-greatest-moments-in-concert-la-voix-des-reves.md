Established as one of Virgin Classics\u2019 bestselling artists, Jaroussky, now aged 34, has been honoured three times in the Victoires de la Musique awards in his native France and has also received Germany\u2019s most prominent music prize, the Echo Klassik. His diverse achievements are saluted in two new collections on Virgin Classics \u2013 the 2CD set \u201cThe Voice\u201d and the DVD and Blu Ray \u201cLa Voix des r\u00eaves: Greatest moments in Concert\u201d.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wm3TXSHScYmcxjzxnCuloQiD4U.jpg", "actors": ["Philippe Jaroussky (Himself)", "Marie-Nicole Lemieux (Herself)", "Nuria Rial (Herself)", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ducros (Himself)", "Gautier Capu\u00e7on (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
