Stories are framed by the lecture of a university professor. In one tale a Boston resident becomes angry when the census forgets to record her presence. Another sketch chronicles the achievements of African Americans while still another pays tongue-in-cheek tribute to Texas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mVhK6DAuVVKZKMqktF1IazUSk5Q.jpg", "actors": ["Ethel Barrymore (Mrs. Brian Patrick Riordan)", "Keefe Brasselle (Sgt.
