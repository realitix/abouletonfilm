For almost fifty years he and his band \u2018Tangerine Dream\u2019 explored sound and its effect on our emotions. This film about one of Germany\u2019s first electronic bands kicks off with the young Berlin musicians who were as inspired by the space age of the 1960s, with its rocket launchings and visions of the future, as they were by their own heartbeat, on which Froese also based compositions. Aided by the Moog and other synthesisers Froese (and various band members) revolutionised popular music. His explorations took him into the worlds of classical, new and film music. He preferred to visualise moods rather than create clearly structured songs.  A blend of amateur footage, interviews with band members, relatives, friends and colleagues such as Jean-Michel Jarre that creates a comprehensive portrait of an artistic pioneer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/atOxNYZC1ABVbskdidI8NXD4flY.jpg", "actors": ["Tangerine Dream (Themselves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
