Fans came out by the tens of thousands to see them hopefully get their comeuppance. They were hated, and loved for being hated. But no one knew that an implosion to that original Horsemen line-up was coming. Heck, who thought Ole would ever be cheered?!  But as good as business was, subtle shifts began to signal potential trouble. Crockett moves his entire operation to Dallas upon expanding there, incurring sizable expenses.
