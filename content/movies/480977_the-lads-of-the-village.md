German spies have been using a Peace Society as a front for their nefarious activities (the rotters!), but our stout lads are on to them. They finally rout the blackguards while on active service in the Middle East - or at least the English field that stands in for it! The eponymous lads actually include a lass, who joins up as a nurse.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bernard Dudley (Sir Karl Dusseldorf)", "Maudie Dunham (Maud Ellington)", "Jimmy Learmonth ()", "H.J.
