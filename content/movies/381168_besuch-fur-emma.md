Only cashier Emma feels really lonely. There is nothing wrong with her, she just goes underground in the big city. Her desire to meet people has brought Emma to a strange idea: she lets go in the supermarket purses of customers and later presents herself as a hospitable finder, who invites you to pick up at the laid table. Unfortunately, the visit remains short. Only the shrewd homeless August who sees through her starts to get interested in Emma.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/83tIktEtfquSc7D9yeTK3nSNmD4.jpg", "actors": ["Dagmar Manzel (Emma)", "Henry H\u00fcbchen (August)", "Carl Achleitner (Mann im Supermarkt)", "Uwe Dag Berlin (Kneipengast)", "Pit Bukowski (Jacek)", "Us Conradi (Oma Helga)", "Regine Hentschel (Sandra)", "Traute Hoess (Kneipenwirtin)", "Susanne Jansen (Dame)", "Klara Manzel (Linda)", "Christin Nichols (Studentin)", "Franz Rogowski (Arne)", "Marie R\u00f6nnebeck (Steffi)", "Asad Schwarz (Kinobesitzer)", "Anna Thalbach (Maggie)", "Ivan Gallardo (Nachbar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
