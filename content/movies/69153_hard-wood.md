It's a place where a man can strip away his clothes and be at one with nature, a place to get in-touch with his deepest primal urges. In this wild and remote setting the men of Hard Wood roam naked and free. Rugged, wild and always on the prowl, they have a sexual hunger than can only be satisfied in the wild. Hear nature's call. Lose yourself in the wilderness of Hard Wood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8DPxEua0IJx1pr1cVa06f396gMQ.jpg", "actors": ["Brenden Cage ()", "Dominic Valentine ()", "Ethan Hudson ()", "John Sebastian ()", "Marc Vallint ()", "Marko Lebeau ()", "Mike Matters ()", "Gabriel Clark ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
