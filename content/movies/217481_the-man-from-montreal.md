The stars are cast respectively as fur trapper Clark Manning and constable Bones Blair, who carry on a friendly rivalry in the Canadian Northwest. Our heroes team up in the final reels to put the kibosh on a fur-smuggling racket, permitting Universal to plunge deeply into its stock-footage files. The leading ladies this time out are Anne Gwynne and Kay Sutton, their billing status indicating which one of the two ladies will land Clark Manning in the last scene. Incredibly, the Arlen-Devine series lasted for 14 films, none of them classics but all of them worthwhile Saturday-matinee fare.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gYzrjapPrL7mkLYw15e9Kod2bIF.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Arlen (Clark Manning)", "Andy Devine (Constable 'Bones' Blair)", "Anne Gwynne (Doris Blair)", "Kay Sutton (Myrna Montgomery, aka Mrs. Myrna Rawlins)", "Reed Hadley (Ross Montgomery, aka L.
