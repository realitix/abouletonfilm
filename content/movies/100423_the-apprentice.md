He's penniless, behind on his rent, with a thin resume and no college units. He has a fianc\u00e9e, Michelle, but his head is turned by a free-spirited model, from the U.S., who saw him being fired and comes to his flat to apologize. She's Elizabeth, a combination of feckless innocence and sexual freedom. Jean-Pierre borrows money from his outlaw friend, Dock, and buys clothes to impress Elizabeth. Soon he's sleeping with her, and he pulls a theft with Dock to get money to take her to Acapulco. Michelle tries to bring him back to her orbit. Is there a way out for Jean-Pierre?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tcFrIsAxinyrAhgrv7BngZqbj44.jpg", "actors": ["Susan Sarandon (Elizabeth Hawkins)", "Steve Fiset (Jean-Pierre Fortier)", "C\u00e9line Bernier (Michelle)", "Jean-Pierre Cartier (Dock)", "Carole Laure (Suzanne)", "Gerard Parkes (Professor)", "Paul Berval (Le Pr\u00eatre)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
