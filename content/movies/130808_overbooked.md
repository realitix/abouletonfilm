However, due to a booking error at the travel agents, Vanessa ends up on a barren desert island. The next ship doesn\u2019t arrive for another week, so until then she has to cope with oddball lighthouse keeper Stanislav, and the highly unconventional and nonchalant Sebastian, who also has a right to the only shabby guest room. There\u2019s no escape from this island \u2013 and the three gradually get to know each other over schnapps and pie. When a further guest arrives in the form of dubious businessman Felix and a body turns up in Stanislav\u2019s cellar, the insular resort becomes the backdrop for a grotesque fight for life. In his debut feature, Matthias J. Michel cleverly repels various genre and character clich\u00e9s to create an exceptional black comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/grYgLPoQ0w2NEcoFpPbMLbvH6LN.jpg", "actors": ["Markus Aeschlimann (Mann in Wanne)", "Maria Boettner (Vanessa)", "Daniel Frei (Felix)", "Andy Haueter (Ganove)", "Tiziana Jelmini (Suppen Frau)", "Aviva Joel (Geliebte)", "Manfred Liechti (Stanislav)", "Daniel Mezger (Sebastian)", "Philippe Reinhardt (Harald Bloch)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
