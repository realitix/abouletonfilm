In late summer 1973, Michael Skid, the son of a well-to-do judge, returns home and rents a dilapidated farm. He begins to spread the gospel of communal ideals, which he has absorbed during his travels in India. His new worldliness and ideas go over well with impoverished siblings Madonna and Silver Brassaurd and the hopelessly na\u00efve Carrie. They go over less well with Tom Donnerel, a young farmer and Carrie's fianc\u00e9. Wounded by Tom's derision, Michael befriends ex-convict Everette Hatch, who, recognizing opportunity, exploits Michael's ideas to his advantage. Believing himself capable of understanding people from the other side of the track, Michael fails to recognize that the ex-con is manipulating him and so sets off a catastrophic chain of events in the community", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wukUVEmp8rjQ0huKnoDa8uNonce.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Outerbridge (Everette Hatch)", "Jonathan Scarfe (Michael Skid)", "Joanne Kelly (Madonna Eveline Brassaurd)", "Christopher Jacot (Robert Allan \"Silver\" Brassaurd)", "Elaine Cassidy (Carrie Matchett)", "Zachary Bennett (Tom Donnerel)", "Torquil Campbell (Vincent Donnerel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
