Filmed in color and b&amp;w on 16mm film, it continues Salmon's interest in the performance of the artist/cinematographer within both spontaneous and constructed situations and incorporates methods developed by various movements within documentary and avant-garde history. Using an array of sounds, music and conversation as well as silence, Salmon constructs an abstract documentary which both develops and challenges the themes presented in Maslow's theory as well as her own interest in human iconography, stereotype and domestic rhythm. The image of Maslow's pyramid and his pragmatic dissection of human needs and possible motivations provide a system of organization for the family and a philosophical framework for the video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6QGUqBy1kBaioWvRMT2dNJpU6GV.jpg", "actors": ["Alban Cocking ()", "Arlo Cocking ()", "Ben Cocking ()", "Emily Guille-Marrett ()", "Philomena Salmon Wiand ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
