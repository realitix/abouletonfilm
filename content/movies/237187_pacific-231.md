At 2:10 in the afternoon, it starts a trip out of the station through the countryside to its destination. The film consists of a montage of shots, some close up, of the engine and its gears and wheels. With the accompanying ambient sounds and an orchestral score, the emphasis is on the engine's power and speed. Parallel lines of multiple tracks, telephone wires, and trees confirm a careful composition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AbpBAwwOrt3UtgSAcKaGnvyikvD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [107551, 197975, 123817, 150994], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
