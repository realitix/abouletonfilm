Witold has been nursing both his sick mother and a deeply rooted desire to climb the Himalayas. His father had died climbing in those mountains, and they have an allure for Witold as well. But his dreams begin to crumble when his mother succumbs to her illness and trouble brews at work. The situation becomes bad enough to scramble Witold's life with no indication of future improvement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o2NOlNmpV2npCcWdxHOK4Ypanu9.jpg", "actors": ["Malgorzata Zajaczkowska (Grazyna)", "Tadeusz Bradecki (Witold)", "Zofia Mrozowska (Witold's Mother)", "Witold Pyrkosz (Mariusz)", "Cezary Morawski (Stefan)", "Ewa Lejczak (Stefan's Wife)", "Jan Jurewicz (Zenek)", "Juliusz Machulski (Wladek)", "Jacek Strzemzalski (Mate)", "Edward Zebrowski (Scientist)", "Krystyna Bigelmajer ()", "Kazimierz Borowiec ()", "Lucjan Dytrych ()", "L.
