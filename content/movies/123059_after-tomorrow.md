Each has a selfish mother: Sydney's is cold, Pete's is clingy. Sidney's mother is looking for her own happiness, no matter how much that search harms her daughter and long-suffering husband; and, the longer the engagement lingers, the more pressure Pete's mom puts on Sidney to break it off and set her son free. \"After Tomorrow\" is Pete and Sidney's favorite song, but with illness, poverty, and temptation: will that good day ever come?
