Part of it is missing sound and final editing because the director was forced to leave Brazil. Horror and humor to deal with the subject of insanity: \u201cIn the end everyone leaves the house as though they were laboratory mice escaping, they invade the city and contaminate the world\u201d. \u201cIf we talk about horror, this film deals with national horror, with Mojica Marins as an emblem. There might be a few touches of Corman and English horror, but it is another level of horror. What transformed the film was the location where we were shooting, the house of a 19th century painter, a receptacle of light. When I arrived and saw that house, that light, I said: \u2018This is the film. This is the horror\u2019. The meaning of the film, its appeal, derives from this laboratory of light\u201d (J. Bressane). \u2014 Torino Film Festival", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yxcOfQR5LlgWhpESfmUowvgrj8U.jpg", "actors": ["Rodolfo Arena ()", "Helena Ignez ()", "Isabella ()", "Lilian Lemmertz ()", "Poty ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
