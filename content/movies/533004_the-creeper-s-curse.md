Coworkers Gwen and Marc realize that their colleague has been placed under a peculiar curse and begin working together together to break this most unusual spell. Together, the trio hysterically wrestle with what appears to be a demonic force inside of Roger, and comically keep it under wraps from their agitated boss.
