SIGN PAINTERS is a history of the craft and features the stories of more than two dozen sign painters working in cities throughout the United States.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Y0wfQolqd2dumnuXmOKBPbLWkb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "IXNbWqnvXuM"}
