Spanish guitars flourish, accordions and harmonicas provide charming melodies, traditional Latin percussion insistently keeps the tempo. Sometimes Andrea shares the spotlight with just a grand piano. Beautiful orchestras remain, but for 'Amor' Andrea stylistically exchanges the grandeur of a 19th century European opera house for the romance of a 20th century Hollywood sound studio. Amor features Latin American classics including: 'Besame Mucho' (the song was a million selling US hit for Jimmy Dorsey &amp; His Orchestra in 1941). Universal. 2006.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7IrJJIfoq3L851bi5NeLKyb0c7B.jpg", "actors": ["Andrea Bocelli (Himself)", "Paty D\u00edaz (Herself)", "Humberto Gatica (Himself)", "Luz Elena Gonz\u00e1lez (Herself - Host)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
