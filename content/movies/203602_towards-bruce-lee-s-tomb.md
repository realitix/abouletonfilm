Upon arrival in Seattle, a sagacious mobster teaches them that it takes more than just a map to find Bruce's tomb, and something more than just a body to master the art of interpersonal communication. Will their relationship survive the mobster's grueling training? Will they be able to channel their enthusiasm towards a common dream? Seattle is a puzzle: will they find a frame pretty enough to hang it on the wall when it's all over?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lnrp7YqCqNbog9hfEo45uEa22PW.jpg", "actors": ["Juli\u00e1n G\u00e9nisson (Juli\u00e1n)", "Lorena Iglesias (Lorena)", "Aaron Rux (Claude)", "Pilar Barrios (Pilar)", "Rub\u00e9n Silva (Rub\u00e9n)", "Miguel Esteban (Chamorro)", "Sara Casano (Dora)", "Jim Cranford (Jeff)", "Ignatius Farray (Brett Walton)", "Payton Hollenbeck (El ni\u00f1o)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wbcRDuRlYlM"}
