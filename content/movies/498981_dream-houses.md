It has also been used in Utopia, Malani's first multiple-screen installation, wherein this film is projected adjacent to the film Utopia, shot after the artist moved to a basic apartment building in a suburb of Bombay. This format allowed her to juxtapose the idealism of the sixties with the later dystopia of urbanism in the seventies.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
