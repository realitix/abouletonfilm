Their mission - to survey and explore for future colonization. When their ship suddenly malfunctions, the crew is forced to crash land on the planet's surface, where crippling heat, poisonous water, and fierce storms threaten their lives at every turn. With a handful of supplies and little hope of rescue, their only option is a grueling four hundred mile trek to their ship's lost supply bunkers. To survive, the men will have to push their endurance to the limit and entrust their lives to a leader who will risk everything to succeed, no matter what the consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/50CPJPFyk7eXnNIT9mPzJr3r58R.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Stapleton (Alexander Todd)", "Michael Otis (Matthias)", "David Jean Thomas (Vincent)", "Christopher Heltai (Robert)", "Markus Botnick (Peter)", "Micheal DiMaggio (John)", "Ted Wycech (Stephen / Ship's medic)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48446, 25043, 58293], "youtube_key": "usl4mK1fJI0"}
