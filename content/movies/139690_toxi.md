At the time the film was made, there were over 3000 children living in Germany who'd been fathered by African American GIs. Referred to as \"mischlings,\" these children were often treated as outcasts because of their illegitimacy and skin color. One such mischling is Toxi (played by herself), who is sent to live with her American father when her mother dies. At first, Toxi is welcomed with opened arms, but the father, who already has two children, has neither the time nor the money to care for the girl. Toxi is then bundled off to an orphanage, sparking a serious rift in her father's family. By concentrating on a highly fictionalized plotline, Toxi tends to ignore the thousands of other mischlings whose lives are far more complex and tragic than that of the film's central character.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zrS1Pj7VQhxsv8MDQ26SDenLS6j.jpg", "actors": ["Elfie Fiegert (Toxi)", "Paul Bildt (Grossvater Rose)", "Johanna Hofer (Grossmutter Helene)", "Carola H\u00f6hn (Charlotte Jenrich)", "Elisabeth Flickenschildt (Tante Wally)", "Ernst Waldow (\u00dcbelhack)", "Erika von Thellmann (Frau \u00dcbelhack)", "Katharina Brauren (Vorsteherin)", "Lotte Brackebusch (Frau Berstel)", "Willy Maertens (Inspektor Plaukart)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
