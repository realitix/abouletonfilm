In her efforts to protect her brother from the authorities, John's sister Lorinda (Cecil Cunningham) opens the door for a series of grisly murders. Hero Peter Thorne (Craig Stevens) and heroine Mary Winfield (Elizabeth Fraser) try to stop John before he overracts-er, kills-again. Absolutely impossible to take seriously, The Hidden Hand is nonetheless worth a glance, if for no other reason than to see perennial bit player Parsons in a juicy leading role. The film was based on Invitation to a Murder, a play by Rufus King.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/48LylO8kq2xOU2kqK8VqsOsr7Wt.jpg", "actors": ["Craig Stevens (Peter Thorne)", "Julie Bishop (Rita Channing)", "Frank Wilcox (Dr. Lawrence Channing)", "Cecil Cunningham (Lorinda Channing)", "Ruth Ford (Estelle Channing)", "Milton Parsons (John Channing)", "Roland Drew (Walter Channing)", "Tom Stevenson (Horace Channing)", "Marian Hall (Nurse Eleanor Stevens)", "Inez Gary (Hattie)", "Kam Tong (Mallo)", "Willie Best (Eustis the Chauffeur)", "Elisabeth Fraser (Mary Winfield)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
