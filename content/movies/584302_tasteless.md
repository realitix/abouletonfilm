With comedy that pushed the boundaries of racism and gender, the Truly Tasteless books are a testament to how comedic culture has transformed over time.

Tasteless examines how the series author, Ashton Applewhite, went from a crude joke author to a feminist activist; how comedy has evolved since the 1980s, and how the dirty jokes of our past stand in today's social climate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eMZSjf6FHBNBzNM7nfU4ZLvOBTo.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Normand (Himself)", "Dan Soder (Himself)", "Helen Hong (Herself)", "Jordan Carlos (Himself)", "Ashton Applewhite (Herself)", "Scott Rogowsky (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
