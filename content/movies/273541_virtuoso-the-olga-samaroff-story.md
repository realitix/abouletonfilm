Her life story also portrays an era in our American cultural heritage that has largely been underserved in the documentary film genre. Texas-born Olga Samaroff a.k.a. Lucy Hickenlooper lived at a time when music was dominated by men and Old World prejudices----and she emerged as a leader among many. Against tremendous odds she rose from complete obscurity to be the most successful American woman concert pianist of the early 20th Century. -  Lorri Holt, Frederica von Stade", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s8Jk27Ao80INEzBV2UunISbrtKj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
