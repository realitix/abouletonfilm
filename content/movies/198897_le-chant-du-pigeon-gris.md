The three have a series of adventures which include saving a soldier from being captured by the Germans, helping out the resistance fighters, and meeting up with a young Russian woman trained in guerrilla warfare. As they learn more about life and danger, various circumstances constantly recall the reality of war itself. The title comes from a wounded pigeon under the care of one of the youngsters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5RWyFD6DtMwYDZZVyON16JRDfqi.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Brecka (Martin)", "Jan Bzduch (Andriusa)", "Karla Chadimov\u00e1 (Natasa)", "Ladislav Chud\u00edk (Milan's father)", "Vladim\u00edr Durd\u00edk (Rudko's father)", "Pavol Pol\u00e1\u010dek (Rudko Hrudka)", "Peter Koll\u00e1rik (Milan)", "Pavol Matto\u0161 (Vinco)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Sov\u00e1k (Fero \u0160losiarik)", "Olga Z\u00f6llnerov\u00e1 (Verona)", "Jan Bzduch (Andrju\u0161a)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
