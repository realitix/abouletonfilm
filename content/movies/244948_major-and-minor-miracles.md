A village curate with paltry attendance at his services gets a call one Sunday in December to meet an emissary from the Vatican who has come to test a child for special powers (he's the young son of a farming couple in the curate's parish; he's come to the Vatican's attention via a roundabout chain of odd events). The curate takes the visitor to the farm, convinced that nothing is out of the ordinary. Then, event by event, the curate comes to think otherwise and must figure out a way to save the child from a life in Rome. Are miracles afoot? The very fact the curate's car starts in mid-winter may be a sign of things to come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n9M49SEMLMaiNTrYFgM3TUttBkO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
