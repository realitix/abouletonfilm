He finds a job at a Catholic home for orphans, where he forms a new soccer team, with the help of one very good player Pepe who turns out to be a girl. 'Pepe' is the sister of one of the orphans, who comes to the all-boy orphanage posing as a boy, because her former foster home was an abusive environment. Along the way, Manny has incurred a gambling debt, his creditors begin to lean on him, and the boys find out. They set up a soccer game and stake the outcome against Manny's debt. If they win, the debt will be forgiven.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/11XQZAZ2E1RL5qad6N7ypOBryZL.jpg", "actors": ["Malachy McCourt ()", "Chet Doherty ()", "Sel Skolnick ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
