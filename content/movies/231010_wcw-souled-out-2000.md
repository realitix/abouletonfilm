The originally scheduled card was heavily changed, due to the serious injuries of Bret Hart and Jeff Jarrett. Hart, who was scheduled to wrestle Sid Vicious, suffered a severe concussion at Starrcade, which forced him to vacate the WCW World Heavyweight title, and eventually retire nine months later. Jarrett, who was scheduled to wrestle Chris Benoit in a Triple Threat Theater series (Dungeon Rules, Bunkhouse, Caged Heat), suffered lingering headaches from Benoit's diving headbutt off the top of the steel cage on the January 10 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, which forced him to vacate the WCW United States Heavyweight title. Benoit was instead moved to take Hart's place against Vicious and the Triple Threat Theater series was contested between Billy Kidman and three separate wrestlers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zDO7QhDSqOQWxJCau6CqNB7Jz8R.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Benoit (Himself)", "Sidney Raymond Eudy (Sid Vicious)", "Terry Funk (Himself)", "Kevin Nash (Himself)", "Michael Jerry Tuite (The Wall)", "Peter Gruner, Jr. (Billy Kidman)", "Dallas Page (Diamond Dallas Page)", "Marcus Alexander Bagwell (Buff Bagwell)", "Tank Abbott (Himself)", "William Martin Brennan (Jerry Flynn)", "Booker Huffman (Booker T)", "Lash Rushay Huffman (Stevie Ray)", "Perry Satullo (Saturn)", "Brian Yandrisovitz (Brian Knobs)", "Dave Finlay (Fit Finlay)", "Norman Smiley (Himself)", "Tonga Fifita (Meng)", "Debrah Ann Miceli (Madusa)", "Vito Joseph LoGrasso (Big Vito)", "Don Harris (Himself)", "Ron Harris (Himself)", "Ian Hodgkinson (Vampiro)", "David Flair (Himself)", "Dean Simon (Dean Malenko)", "Troy Martin (Shane Douglas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
