The premise here is that a small group of modern-day performers have gotten together in a rehearsal studio to celebrate George M. Cohan's life and work. Joel Grey and Bernadette Peters (also from the original cast) and the other cast members are apparently playing themselves, with Austin Pendleton serving as a stage manager/director.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uRTCP8X7U9Z3qRSJPrbXKzATwQY.jpg", "actors": ["Joel Grey (Himself/ George M Cohan)", "Bernadette Peters (Herself/ Josie Cohan)", "Jack Cassidy (Jerry Cohan)", "Nanette Fabray (Nellie Cohan)", "Blythe Danner (Agnes Cohan)", "Red Buttons (Sam H.
