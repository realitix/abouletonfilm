My mother\u2019s past, the only relative I know, is also laden with doubtful stories filled with characters that may not really exists. This personal and family oriented conflict \u2013left unexplored for years-, is the starting point of \u201cHija\u201d. With this film I was faced with the challenges of any work of cinema, but at the same time I was pushed to confront and explore the conflicts that I thought were forgiven and surpassed. It became an experience in which fantasy and reality were no longer my tools to explain the deep and powerful answers of what we can be.  A voyage that became a film and a film that lead me to understand things that had I ever imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dMdhuKAS5uPX5L7vj7svKJXI78y.jpg", "actors": ["Mar\u00eda Paz Gonz\u00e1lez (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
