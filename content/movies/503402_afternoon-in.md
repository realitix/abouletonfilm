Digging in inside. Ink spills: spilt nothing or at least no thing that I was fast enough to film. Light shines on mangled legs, basking like a cat, working on a cut. Sixteen bi-packed, rewind knob, winding back for density; covering the singular moments of time that have already unwound out of the room. Thought in images: ideas and images for a film that will never be made but I make in my head as I check to see if the stove gas is secretly on over and over. And over again. I will not go outside today. It is simply time for an afternoon in to myself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A6lQ1Luv9WBeBQbYKouXxmheY2U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
