George Moffat and Gleb Derujinsky are great pilots and good friends who compete in the sport of Soaring for speed and distance in aircraft without engines - sleek competition gliders. Both would like to win the U.S. Soaring Championship. Derujinsky relies most on feel and creative impulse to sense his way through invisible air currents. Moffat does the same but relies more on a hand calculator he constantly works in his cockpit. This film 'The Sun Ship Game', voyages with both pilots into the sky at a regional contest in Vermont and into wild weather with eighty three other competitors in Marfa, Texas. Through eight days of hard flying in skies alternately filled with brilliant beauty and black violence, their two approaches arrive at a dramatic conclusion and one of them is named the U.S. Champion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/raMWpnv9gFjq33z6hno7n9yjjo.jpg", "actors": ["Gleb Derujinsky (Himself - Pilot / Competitor)", "George Moffat (Himself - Pilot / Competitor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
