He is not really keen about his father's black magic skills and is wiling away his time with two dumb cronies in a remote village. There he meets a girl named Malu (Poonam Bajwa), who has no memories about her past but falls pretty easily for the hero after a couple of songs. But they get separated soon after. Some years later, he is called by a wealthy family to exorcise a spirit (Muktha George) from their palatial house, Shenoy Mandir. He meets Malavika there but she doesn't recognise him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hihTf8qGoYQQfQAVKgq1NrXPYwk.jpg", "actors": ["Jayaram (Mukundan Unni)", "Poonam Bajwa (Malu)", "Muktha George (Rukkumani)", "Suraj Venjaramoodu (Usthad Maambaram Maayankutty Sheikh)", "Devan (Shenayi)", "Indrans (Unniyaathiri)", "Ramesh Pisharody (Subrahmanyan)", "Natasha Doshi (Dia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JHNYDQqSw9s"}
