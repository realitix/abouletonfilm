Selima (Enakshi) is a princess-foundling raised by a potter and loved by her brother, Shiraz (Rai). She is abducted and sold as a slave to Prince Khurram, later Emperor Shah Jehan (Roy), who falls for her, to the chagrin of the wily Dalia (Seeta Devi). When Selima is caught is Shiraz, the young man is condemned to be trampled to death by an elephant. A pendant reveals Selima's royal status and she saves her brother, marries the prince and becomes Empress Mumtaz Mahal while Dalia is banned for her machinations against Selima. When Selima dies (1629), the emperor builds her a monument to the design of the now old and blind Shiraz, the Taj Mahal. The film contains a number of passionate kissing scenes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pKaQ94Az4iHmSS43RkzrglbaJLO.jpg", "actors": ["Himansu Rai (Shiraz)", "Enakshi Rama Rau (Selima)", "Charu Roy (Prince Khurram)", "Seeta Devi (Dalia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Plzfn64AR8E"}
