Its characters sift for clues buried in archives of mind and place and historical memory, seeking to uncover a narrative that could unlock the past and settle matters of life and death in the present.  Each of the five main characters whose destinies collide in Granito are connected by the Guatemala of 1982, then engulfed in a war where a genocidal \u201cscorched earth\u201d campaign by the military exterminated nearly 200,000 Maya people. Now, as if a watchful Maya god were weaving back together threads of a story unraveled by the passage of time, forgotten by most, our characters become integral to the overarching narrative of wrongs done and justice sought that they have pieced together, each adding their granito, their tiny grain of sand, to the epic tale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6KqoofkwzGIU2nk7L68vtWmv3Dx.jpg", "actors": ["Rigoberta Menchu ()", "Fredy Peccerelli ()", "Alejandra Garcia ()", "Kate Doyle ()", "Antonio Caba Caba ()", "Almudena Bernabeu ()", "Gustavo Meono ()", "Naomi Roht-Arriaza ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
