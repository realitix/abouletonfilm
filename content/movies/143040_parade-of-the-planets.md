The men first get together when called up for military maneuvers in the equivalent of a civilian reserve corps. Since their training is only periodical, two years go by before they are called up again. During this season's maneuvers, they end up being \"killed,\" and so get some time off before they have to go home, and that is when the strange occurrences start. First the men visit a town of beautiful women and go swimming in the buff, then they land on a deserted island, and later, they find themselves with a group of elderly people, one of whom may - or may not - have a connection to one of the men.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mLv7hYb6DD7IW0qB6VnDp7gXwwc.jpg", "actors": ["Oleg Borisov (Kostin)", "Sergey Shakurov (Sultan)", "Sergey Nikonenko (Afonin)", "Aleksandr Pashutin (Spirkin)", "Pyotr Zaychenko (Pukhov)", "Aleksei Zharkov (Slonov)", "Boris Romanov (Chemist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [71018, 344799, 100638, 262882], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
