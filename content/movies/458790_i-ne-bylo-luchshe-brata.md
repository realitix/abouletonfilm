The elder brother Jalil is a married postal worker who keeps bees as a hobby. Younger brother Simurg is more adventurous by nature and capable of going after his goals, not just dreaming about them. Jalil has a recurring memory: once, when he was still a kid, his mother, pregnant with Simurg, took him to a women\u2019s sauna. When both brothers fall in love for the same beautiful girl, their differences become apparent once again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5CLUfyy3FyOklCkKjuIbKIdKZTX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qcR1bZ0XYwQ"}
