It is a story about the continuity and collapse of history, the power of suppression, and the terror of reconciliation; loyalty, treason and revenge. In a brave cinematic game, Heinrich B\u00f6ll\u2019s story Billiards at Half-Past Nine is split up into cracks, blocks, breaks and sudden turns, as the life story of a German family, covering numerous generations, is propelled forward. Terms such as \u201cinterwar period\u201d and \u201cpost-war period\u201d are blown up with a single cut, word or click of a billiard ball. Not Reconciled remains one of the most important German film of the past fifty years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ys6DIc2TWRhurrPmZN23EEQZXEX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [131792, 236063, 355505, 198569], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
