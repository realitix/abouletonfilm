Yoshimoto proves this point with most simplicity. Placing a tiny point of ray in pitch black, his darkness achieves a limitless depth. This style goes under trial from around 1988 \u2013 a squirming object in drowning darkness goes through a transition from a solid machinery part to a soft Japanese architectural fixture to a misty female figure. Each of the objects, a subject of fancy, is placed in good balance, mingling with Rei Harakami's sound effects. This is one of Yoshimoto's most intense works.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3n5PyakoBISmlRJQfYYb8ztys9i.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
