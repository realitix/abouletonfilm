Time is, in fact, what I see as my main material. THE BACK STEPS is a demonstration of that particular interests. The image loops but also progresses forward. That is fairly easy to see. However, the sound, while having looping elements, has a compositional structure that changes throughout the piece. I imagine most pieces as a series of overlain arcs, each of a different length and height and each representing a different durational element in the piece. Another way to imagine this is to think of a mechanical clock with many different internal rhythms, all of which move the hands steadily forward.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cW8oEdG2IFuUK51xuKU5KRnseBs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
