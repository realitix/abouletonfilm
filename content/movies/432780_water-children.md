She created a cathedral-like space out of twelve thousand white silk dresses in which visitors, as in a ritual, roamed around and fell silent. And where people confessed intimate details about children who were or were not born, about sexuality and life-choices. This resulted in a majestic epic about motherhood, miscarriages and menopause. In a visual and poetic way, the film penetrates into what is probably still one of the greatest of taboos, menstruation, and, as a consequence, touches upon universal themes around life and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gsgxqZziQ3DSbfELtGbHksQthkY.jpg", "actors": ["Tomoko Mukaiyama (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
