The main event of the show saw Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel in a No Holds Barred match for the WWF Championship. Other matches on the card included The Bodydonnas defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Godwinns and The Ultimate Warrior defending his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Goldust.  The event marked the last televised appearances of the performers behind the Diesel and Razor Ramon characters in the WWF until 2002. It would not be the final portrayal of the Diesel and Razor Ramon characters in he WWF, however: Glenn Jacobs and Rick Bognar delivered a short-lived portrayal of the characters from late 1996 to early 1997, and Nash revived the Diesel character for one night only at the 2011 Royal Rumble.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uMKEsdlt76cQ03yxA7wFnNg4lwL.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Shawn Hickenbottom (Himself)", "Kevin Nash (Diesel)", "Dustin Runnels (Goldust)", "Christopher Barrett Candito (Skip)", "Tom Prichard (Zip)", "Dennis Knight (Phineas Godwinn)", "Leon Allen White (Vader)", "Scott Hall (Razor Ramon)", "Owen James Hart (Himself)", "Davey Boy Smith (The British Bulldog)", "Aurelian Jake Smith Jr. (Himself)", "Tony Norris (Ahmed Johnson)", "Marc Mero (Himself)", "The Ultimate Warrior (Himself)", "Mark Canterbury (Henry Godwinn)", "Tammy Sytch (Sunny)", "Jim Morris (Hillbilly Jim)", "Rena Marlette Lesnar (Sable)", "Sean Michael Waltman (1-2-3 Kid)", "Ted DiBiase (The Million Dollar Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cgkxzyOwmFc"}
