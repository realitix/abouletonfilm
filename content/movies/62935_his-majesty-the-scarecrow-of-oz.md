The camera follows two farmers placing a Scarecrow upon a pole in a cornfield. Pon rescues a Kansas girl named Dorothy from the evil witch Mombi, whom Princess Gloria has been taken to by King Krewl to freeze her heart so she will no longer love Pon. An Indian princess has a ceremony to bring the Scarecrow to life. Pon rescues the cold-hearted princess and they flee for help, discovering the Scarecrow, who promptly falls in love with the princess, and Button-Bright, a lost boy from America. They come to the castle of the Tin Emperor, Nick Chopper, and after oiling him, he falls in love with Gloria. After a bit of a chase aided by the Sawhorse and the Wizard, Mombi turns Pon into a Kangaroo, and a slough of Fred Woodward's animals battle it out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/poyIlUHUa95yFgqFnuKEjXOHRcW.jpg", "actors": ["Violet MacMillan (Dorothy)", "Frank Moore (The Scarecrow)", "Pierre Couderc (The Tin Woodman)", "Fred Woodward (The Cowardly Lion / The Kangaroo / The Crow / The Cow / The Mule)", "Raymond Russell (King Krewl)", "Arthur Smollet (Googly-Goo)", "J.
