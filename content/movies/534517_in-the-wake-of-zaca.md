Few sailing vessels are surrounded by more myth and legend than the yacht Zaca. Launched on the eve of the great depression, the 118' gaff-rigged topsail schooner has sailed through 75 years of history from one remarkable adventure to the next. Zaca has served as a luxuary yacht, scientific research vessel, navy patrol boat and party boat for Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn. This documentary offers a riveting window into the past as seen through the eyes of this historic ship and the survivors of those who sailed her. Produced and directed by Luther Greene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zW1HSNAEv8kpp0pmOcmLeFkERJ5.jpg", "actors": ["Patrice Wymore (Narrator / Herself - Co-Owner 1950-1965 (as Patrice Wymore Flynn))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tajMU6x20nI"}
