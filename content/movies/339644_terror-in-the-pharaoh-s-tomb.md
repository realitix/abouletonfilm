Ace Zucco has a new partner, reporter Fay Kendall, who is more than a match for the rowdy photographer. Daily Dispatch editor Mac sends them on assignment accompanying his niece Kate as she tries to find Rick Banning, her fianc\u00e9e, an archeologist who disappeared while working in Egypt. A letter from Rick directs them to Lord Darby in England.
