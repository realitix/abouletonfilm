Together Emilia and David look at the Ripper\u2019s modus operandi using modern technology - like a digital autopsy table - and recreating the murder sites to help understand the extraordinary risks the Ripper took to kill his victims. Also, using the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System (HOLMES), a bespoke computer system used by the police to help detect patterns in criminal activity, and evidence uncovered within the investigation, results strongly indicate that Martha Tabram was in fact the first Ripper victim.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4mQEBGAL8uebPhDdPHBkivg9Tgh.jpg", "actors": ["Emilia Fox (Herself - Presenter)", "David Wilson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
