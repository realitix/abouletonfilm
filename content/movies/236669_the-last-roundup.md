The first shell is spot on. He backs up against a tree, and this shell comes in low, sending Gandy through a whole line of trees. The \"dud\" explodes, and sends both Gandy and his sergeant rocketing into the air. They land in a haystack; when all the insects greet them with \"Heil\", they figure out they're in Germany, conveniently near a piglike Hitler and his monkey, Mussolini.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
