He is always making fun of everything wrong with the human behaviour such as stupidity, greed or vanity. His attitude and actions always bring damages to the mean, evil and materialistic people. So beside the jokes, the movie has this philosophical layer, undoubtedly because Pacala's independent way of being, free spirit and his love for the nature creates a way of seeing life, bringing joy. Filmed in a very beautiful part of Romania in 1974, the movie had an important success at that time and it is considered one of the most loved movies in Romania ever.  Like the hero, found in many stories and jokes, the movie forwards the spirit of true freedom and pure link with the nature, forgetting about times and governments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4xVnXMb3KAj6vhq7sNbxvvBFZ0C.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
