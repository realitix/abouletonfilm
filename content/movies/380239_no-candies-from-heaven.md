The film records daily life behind the walls of one of these institutions, in which a hard-working staff of nannies, nurses and volunteers take care of about fifty children aged from a few months to twelve years. Filmed in cinema-verite style and based on observation, it explores the complex fabric of the diverse, transient community that lives isolated in this home away from home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dLLlnV9zF6fseuqu9sLxA6AIDDU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
