In LeLouche's rendition, there are no such inadequacies. The focus is on culture - heritage, modernity and (what soon would be named) Westernization. Past and present meet - veils and miniskirts, camels and helicopters, remains of ancient Persia, the highlights of Islamic art, caviar and the oil fields and gas pumps.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iuiRCf9yrWVwWz2QhLN5XfYXF2i.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
