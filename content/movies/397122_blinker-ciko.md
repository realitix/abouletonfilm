The over indulgence of affection and praise has given the boy an over confidence. This is quickly squashed by his new peers when the family returns to the Czech Republic. This leads to neurotic tics and the nickname Mrk\u00e1cek the 'Blinker.' A stay at a children's camp provides new friends, acceptance, an appreciation of nature, a new outlook on life, and loss of the tics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sarmFXo0z9gJe1l6Adn42sIb6N2.jpg", "actors": ["Filip Menzel (Ciko, Mrk\u00e1cek the 'Blinker')", "Jakub Step\u00e1n (Smatla)", "V\u00edt Olmer (Hlava the Father)", "Marie M\u00e1lkov\u00e1 (Hlavova the Mother)", "Pavel Nov\u00fd (Pust\u00edk)", "Michal Nesvadba (Ex)", "Marcela Pen\u00e1zov\u00e1 (Korelka)", "Elena Strupkov\u00e1 (Petarkova (as Elena Stropkov\u00e1))", "Jir\u00ed Pr\u00fdmek (Porter)", "V\u00e1clav Hel\u0161us (Kub\u00e1k)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
