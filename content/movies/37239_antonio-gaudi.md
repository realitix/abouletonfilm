Here, their artistry melds in a unique, enthralling cinematic experience. Less a documentary than a visual poem, Teshigahara's Antonio Gaud\u00ed takes viewers on a tour of Gaud\u00ed s truly spectacular architecture, including his massive still-unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia cathedral, in Barcelona. With camerawork as bold and sensual as the curves on his subject s organic surfaces, Teshigahara immortalizes Gaud\u00ed on film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hP6DD4YHVHAYPf8lLeboLTp4RHE.jpg", "actors": ["Isidro Puig Boada ()", "Seiji Miyaguchi (Boada (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [260793, 113989, 204178, 110921], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
