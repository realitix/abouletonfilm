It also a sexually unresponsive wife's revenge against her cheating husband. Heiress Georgina Oliphant, the daughter of pharmaceutical magnate George Oliphant is on a mission to find a sculptor suitable of her father's sponsorship. Normally, George doesn't give a hoot about art, but tax time approaches and he needs a big deduction. Since large bronze statues are 100% deductible, that's what he wants. Georgina comes through with the lesbian sculptor Lily Carmichael who suggests a detailed male nude, sans fig leaf. For her model, lily chooses unemployed hunk Karl-Heinz Applebaum who at first doesn't realize he is to model totally nude. Fortunately, coquettish Georgina is around to convince him to shed those clothes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vGYnZjR2boJcpggGm6M8adREiat.jpg", "actors": ["Nicholas Hope ()", "Gosia Dobrowolska ()", "Claudia Karvan ()", "Victoria Eagger ()", "Chris Haywood ()", "John Hargreaves ()", "Norman Kaye ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
