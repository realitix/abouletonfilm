One day, the band received a microphone as the present from a mysterious fan. Miraculously, the microphone was a time-machine that accidentally took them to the future, in 2007, where the modern music rules and they're just an out-of-date item. The only way to bring them back to their glorious time is performing a concert to energize the microphone, the time-machine. But, before the concert could be set, there're still some problems in the new world that they have to deal with.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bw9hTflpEthYDqU3XPdfe7e0LuT.jpg", "actors": ["Apisit Opasaimlikit (Toi)", "Piya Satraweha (Bo)", "Tanakorn Chinakul (Bae)", "Chakrapong Siririn (Song Baby)", "Yuthana Thuwapradit (Knot)", "Focus Jirakul ()", "Kaneungnich Jaksamithanon (Toi's Girlfriend (as Khanungnit Jaksamitthanont))", "Kreangsak Riantong (Oo)", "Adirek Wattaleela (Cop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SV7P8Mi9b5I"}
