When the Velvets announced plans for a reunion tour in Europe, opening for U2 on select dates there, expectations of a U.S. tour rose to a fever pitch. Tragically the Velvets broke up once again before reaching the states. The Velvet Underground reunion may never have reached America, but as live DVDs go, Live MCMXCIII stands as a fitting tribute to both Morrison and the legacy of The Velvet Underground.
