It's a poetical story about two young theatre actors who are given a task - to create an \u00e9tude, to imagine a story. Through their rehearsal they are trying to recreate a true event of their life in order to find a peace in their souls. By discovering the beauty of small details in life young people are trying to get rid of their fear for death in understanding that death is a memory of one's living. The dot is the ending - and the beginning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kyBUvu0xCwwWnoLGyh7rlJzKpFG.jpg", "actors": ["Clotilde Rigaud (Matilda)", "Simonas Storpir\u0161tis (Dainius)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Aj1wKt2WLhc"}
