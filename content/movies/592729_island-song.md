{"tmdb_id": 592729, "title": "Island Song", "original_title": "Island Song", "slug_title": "island-song", "date": "1976-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Strapping a video camera to himself as he drives a motorcycle around an island, Palestine harmonizes with the engine, maniacally repeating the phrase, \"Gotta get outta here...gotta get outta here...\" His chanting voice merges with the vibrations of the motor, forming an incessant soundtrack that echoes the jarring motion of the camera. Palestine creates a kind of composite instrument in motion as well as an \"articulated personal drama\". His stated desire for escape is contained by the boundaries of the island. Palestine was a trained cantor, and he often used his moving body and sustained vocalizing to generate a physical and aural intensity in his musical/video performances of this period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jOsnWYnefZbKwwtXwYILL5oUcpw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
