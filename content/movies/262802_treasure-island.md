Rock him with your most beautiful voice, lower and lower, until he goes back to sleep but still listening, subliminally. Now, he must be dreaming, but completing the story you were whispering. When the son wakes up, he must feel like the story chose him and not the opposite. Immortal story, was the title of an Orson Welles' film (who also acted in a previous version of Stevenson's Treaure Island); but every story is immortal, is what any Raoul Ruiz's film tells us", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gGj0QakPBWvVteX3gDIdkOwoW5O.jpg", "actors": ["Vic Tayback (Silver)", "Martin Landau (The Captain)", "Anna Karina (Mother)", "Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud (Midas)", "Melvil Poupaud (Jim Hawkins)", "Lou Castel (Doctor / Father)", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois St\u00e9venin (Israel Hands)", "Jeffrey Kime (Timothy (The Squire))", "Pedro Armend\u00e1riz Jr. (Mendoza)", "Yves Afonso (French Captain)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
