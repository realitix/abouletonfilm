Darwin recognized that the fossils collected by scientists prior to 1859 did not correspond with his theory of evolution, but he predicted that his theory would be confirmed as more and more fossils were found. One hundred and fifty years later, Evolution: The Grand Experiment critically examines the viability of Darwin's theory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yOYLQjMEYyEAFxOjEFEXN3gIL8e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
