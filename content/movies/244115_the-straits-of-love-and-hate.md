Here the balance between distance and involvement is perfectly achieved \u2013 one sympathizes profoundly with the ill-treated heroine while remaining aware of the social conditions which create her plight. In fact, of all Mizoguchi\u2019s prewar films, this is the most positive in its feminism: his heroine is not doomed, but permitted to rebel successfully against the cruel patriarch who seeks to separate her from her child.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1E4e0Im1scqEloWF8InpilSYUNK.jpg", "actors": ["Fumiko Yamaji (Fumi Murakami)", "Seizabur\u00f4 Kawazu (Yoshitaro Suzuki)", "Taiz\u00f4 Fukami ()", "Akira Haruki ()", "Kiyoshi Kat\u00f4 ()", "Yutaka Mimasu (Kenkichi's father)", "Kaoru Nobe (Satako)", "Joe Ohara ()", "Masao Shimizu (Kenkichi, Owner of Inn)", "Ichir\u00f4 Sugai (Sanjuro Mori)", "Chieko Takehisa ()", "Suzuko Taki ()", "Haruo Tanaka (Kinkichi's friend, Hirose)", "Hiroshi Ueda ()", "Kumeko Urabe (Ume)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
