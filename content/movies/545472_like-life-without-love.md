Overwhelmed with emotions, she fails the audition, but manages to convince the director to go out for a walk, which then transforms his day into a pleasant evening spent in her company. The desire for love shared by the two single souls jump starts the clockworks of a miracle, which for some reason fails to develop. A classical tale of how everything that transpires with a girl happens mostly inside her head.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/szZLpzJ58zTCvSlxrHBBMknGfQn.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksandr Yatsenko ()", "Anna Shepeleva ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
