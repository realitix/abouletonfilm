Video Tape Study No.3 is a direct media intervention, in which Paik distorts and manipulates footage from news conferences by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and New York Mayor Lindsey. In a witty performative gesture, Paik briefly asserts his presence by waggling his finger at the screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7wmfPTpUSYGQUm3qQJvqeA12gW4.jpg", "actors": ["Lyndon Johnson (Himself (archive footage))", "John V.
