Their montage sifts through these \u201cimages of a deadly gaze\u201d for the reality they conspicuously elide, for the resistance that has retreated \u201cbehind the mask\u201d. The soundtrack blends together poetry, recitations, and experimental music into a polyphonic swan song to colonial violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xfVaDXF0MJESHGKCfjibqneTdNW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
