The film comprises one still and highly sober shot of Cocteau facing the camera head-on to address the youth of the future. Once recorded, this spoken message for the 21st century was wrapped up, sealed and posted on the understanding that it would be opened only in the year 2000 (as it turned out, it was discovered and exhumed a few years shy of that date). If in The Testament Cocteau portrays himself as a living anachronism, a lonesome classical modernist loitering in space-time in the same buckskin jacket and tie while lost in the spectral light of his memories, here he acknowledges explicitly the irony of his phantom-like state: by the time the viewer sees this image, he, J. C., our saviour Poet, will long be dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eh1xuEqMVEA0E3yIWvllP7aaV7z.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Cocteau (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
