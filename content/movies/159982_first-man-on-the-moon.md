Drawing heavily on unbroadcast archive footage and the unique perspectives of the contributors, this is an exclusive account of Neil Armstrong's extraordinary life story. From his childhood during America's Great Depression to the heady days of the space programme, his historic first step on the Moon and his famously private later life. Seen through the eyes of those who were with him, the film explores the man behind the myth, a man who was very much a product of his time.  The film goes beyond his days as an astronaut and shows that his life after the flight of Apollo 11 was, in many ways equally challenging, as Armstrong came to terms with life outside NASA and the relentless demands of fame until his death in August 2012.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bHqMZR1rlEgENewFMC2XDalkAcX.jpg", "actors": ["Corey Johnson (Narrator)", "Neil Armstrong (Himself)", "Michael Collins (Himself)", "Buzz Aldrin (Himself)", "Dave Scott (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
