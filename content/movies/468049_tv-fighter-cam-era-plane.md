Using a Russian-doll structure of images repeatedly rerecorded and reframed, Hall toys with the viewer\u2019s manifold experiences of live and recorded time: the historical time of archival footage, the live experience of watching it on a screen, the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of watching that \u201clive\u201d footage again on another monitor. This nesting of recorded images within other recorded images implies an emergent sensibility in which the present moment is continually being recorded and reframed by audiovisual apparatus, but crucially Hall\u2019s approach to this phenomenon is as playful as it is provocative.
