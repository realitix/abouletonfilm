The action starts as Billy the Kid, in full living color, walks out of the photo and gets a job as a waiter. Along with him on the working staff are a samurai straight out of the history books, a G.I. from World War II, and several other anachronistic characters. The plot (as such) revolves around keeping away the brutal mobsters and thugs who dominate the city streets outside of the bar, making the tavern safe for its easily recognized facsimiles of well-known characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xaWqo9LykLGObuACawaGJ6ZvYEe.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshiki Arizono ()", "Makoto Ayukawa (Sasaki)", "Yoshio Harada (Harry Callahan)", "Toshiyuki Hosokawa (Mystery man)", "Renji Ishibashi (Bartender)", "Shin'ichir\u00f4 Kurimoto (Professor)", "Hiroshi Mikami (Billy)", "Yuji Miyaji (News Anchorman)", "Shigeru Muroi (Miyuki Nakajima)", "Takashi Naito (Musashi Miyamoto)", "K\u00f4en Okumura (Old man)", "Mark Oriani (Ryan)", "Masayuki Shionoya (Bruce Springsteen)", "Rokk\u00f4 Toura (Marx)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
