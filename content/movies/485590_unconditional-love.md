Let their stories serve as a call to all of us to love in this same way. God has called us to a life different from the world around us . . . a life of service to Him. But in our culture, this call has been affected by selfishness, materialism, and a lack of global focus. This film chronicles real people showing unconditional love. Let the stories of Big Oak Ranch, Kids Off The Block, Front Porch Ministry, and Blood Water Mission serve as a call to all of us to love unconditionally.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Fvdu6HjM4XqE0d9EHqlY7Xjo1L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
