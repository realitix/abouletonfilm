Upon her release three years later, she\u2019s a shamed woman confined to living in the shadowy world of sex clubs and street gangs. She returns to the city to live with her uncle, a billiard-hall owner, and after befriending pimp and ne\u2019er-do-well Ryuji (Tsunehiko Watase), she gets a job working at a hostess club in the chic Ginza neighborhood, where the expensive shops and neon lights conceal a dark world of crime and sexual slavery. But when a rival gang attempts to muscle in on the club, Nami becomes enmeshed in a violent struggle that forces her to wield a skilled pool cue to defend her uncle\u2019s business, and eventually a short sword to wreak bloody vengeance upon her enemies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Q37LgFbGLTkuGqDxncXYHdRrGi.jpg", "actors": ["Meiko Kaji (Nami)", "Akiko Koyama (Kayo)", "Tatsuo Umemiya ()", "K\u00f4ji Nanbara ()", "Mieko Aoyagi (Saeko)", "Meg Flower (Yuka)", "Takeshige Hatanaka (\u00d4wada's Henchman)", "Rena Ichinose (Female Prisoner)", "Tomiko Ishii (Ky\u00f4ko)", "Hiroshi Itsuki ()", "Yoshiko Iwamoto (Mari)", "Tsunehiko Watase (Ry\u00fbji)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39025, 71057, 43226, 30788], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
