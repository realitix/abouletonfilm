JCVD, occupying the other space on the cover, is actually a lead role in the movie though, but he hasn't been in a good movie in **years** so that's doesn't bode particularly well. The real problems with _Black Water_ are less to do with the actors though (most of whom are, admittedly, bad) and more to do with the fact that that it doesn't offer a single thing that's original, or even an unoriginal thing done well. The way it is going to end up is completely transparent from the word go, and a couple of minimal-level of acceptable action sequences alongside a Dolph cameo, do nothing to change that.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [514690, 529649, 531647, 462181], "youtube_key": "8jtnZbWzNbk"}
