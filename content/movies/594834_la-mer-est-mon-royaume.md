Cosmopolitan, resourceful young men from the Ukraine, the Philippines, from Ghana or Trinidad, enticed by the slogan \u201cSee the world for free\u201d and the promise of a job! For ten months, the film follows these new globalised sailors across the oceans while they gain experience and cope with the isolation. They communicate in \u201cGlobish\u201d, a sort of scattered, heavily accented English and look towards Andrei, the \u201cchief mate\u201d from the Ukraine, a central figure on board.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6OigurCLgrF1Uvgo23UiqzfhBWC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
