With the accompaniment of a gospel choir and a brass section and with films by artist JIm Lambie the band brought this brilliant album to life from the ecstatic opening of 'Movin' On Up', through the soul ballads 'Damaged' and 'Shine Like Stars' and on to the triumphant finale of 'Higher Than The Sun', 'Loaded' and 'Come Together'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zRm4KsCl9JfYfhY7aQ52itkGG7W.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
