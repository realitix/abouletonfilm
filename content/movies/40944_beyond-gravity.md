Richard an astronomy-obsessed worrier spends his time fantasising about outerspace and the cosmos, an activity which antagonises friends and family. Then one day he meets Johnny, a handsome Italian man, with an enormous appetite for life, whose idea of a holiday involves breaking into the nearest small holiday home. He offers him love and an escape from the monotony of work. This short New Zealand film is a joyous celebration of the love between two eccentrics. It is also a refreshingly matter-of-fact and comic treatment of a romance between two men who both have their sights aimed firmly amongst the stars.  Released on the compiliations: Boys on Film Volume 3 (1994)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pheYJKhcD2HonEdNulEZpR3X6qM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
