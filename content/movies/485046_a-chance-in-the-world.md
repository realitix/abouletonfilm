From the day he is five-years-old and dropped off at his foster home of the next eleven years, Steve is mentally and physically tortured by Betty (his foster mother), Willie (her husband) and his foster siblings. Desperate for a sense of family and belonging, Steve searches for his biological parents, but no one in the system can help him. No one can tell him why, with obvious African-American features, he has the last name of Klakowicz.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tX3sI78LqcPeUdSkdAMYuERUWNd.jpg", "actors": ["Terrell Ransom Jr. (Steve)", "Kelly Owens (Betty)", "Tom Sizemore (John Sykes)", "Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs (Willie Robinson)", "Nicholas Turturro (Mike Silvia)", "Fred Williamson (Charlie)", "Steffie Grote (Marian Klakowicz)", "Jane Morris (Mrs. Levin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
