Something that would let the world know there was still some pride left in Caribbean cricket. He had to take back his world record.  Returning to Antigua, scene of Lara\u2019s 375 against England a decade before, the West Indies captain was on a mission: to reclaim the highest individual test score he\u2019d lost when Australia\u2019s Matthew Hayden scored 380 against Zimbabwe in 2003. This DVD tells the full story of how Lara hit back at his critics (and England\u2019s feared pace attack) to not only surpass Hayden, but go on to become the first man in history to register a test score of 400. A fitting tribute to arguably the world\u2019s greatest batsman, this is a must for all cricket fans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3No1nRTGOKIyVSZCE5lv2uIQnk2.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Bishop (Himself)", "Ian Botham (Himself)", "Geoffrey Boycott (Himself)", "Tony Cozier (Himself)", "Andrew Flintoff (Himself)", "Angus Fraser (Himself - Commentator)", "Chris Gayle (Himself)", "David Gower (Himself - Presenter)", "Michael Holding (Himself - Commentator)", "Nasser Hussain (Himself)", "Brian Lara (Himself)", "David Lloyd (Himself - Commentator)", "Viv Richards (Himself - Commentator)", "Graham Thorpe (Himself)", "Michael Vaughan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
