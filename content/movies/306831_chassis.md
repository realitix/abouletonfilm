Deep in debt and receiving little help from her husband, Nora has nothing to live for except for Sarah. Living in a community suffering from abject poverty, Nora sifts through trash and spends time with Vilma, a happily single shopkeeper, and Minda, whose truck-driver husband disappeared a month ago presumably to live with another woman. With no other viable options to support her daughter, Nora turns to prostitution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y57Ml1AGghB8HwyFJIdLSSsroDs.jpg", "actors": ["Angeli Bayani ()", "Jodi Sta.
