Blue or stag movies were produced secretly in homes, the film washed in bathtubs, then circulated discreetly, because it was a felony to be caught viewing or possessing them. Several of the shorts in this collection begin with the protective disclaimer \"This film is released for art classes and art students and is not intended for public exhibition.\" Also featured in this collection is rare footage of burlesque queen, actress Sally Rand performing her famous Bubble Dance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
