The film that resulted from his Cairo sojuourn is a complex, painterly critique of the Egyptian musical and cinema star system. At the same time, the film shows the divergent states of possibility or despair faced by men and women within a changing Egyptian society. Smihi\u2019s film plays out over thirty years and the events of the Nasserite years and the Palestine / Israel conflict become integral to the narrative. By blending newsreel footage with his own lush cinematography, Smihi creates a complex portrait of contemporary Egyptian society in the post-war years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qir8GoHBIDy3MecWKZoXAjZs5Qw.jpg", "actors": ["Ezzat El Alaili ()", "Layla Olwy ()", "Sanaa Gamil ()", "Yousra ()", "Gamil Ratib ()", "Huda Sultan ()", "Hisham Salim ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
