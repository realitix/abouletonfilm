The band members smoke colossal amounts of weed, chug gallons of beer from two-story tall funnels, gulp whiskey and Jagermeister from the bottle and eat every processed meat sold at truck stops. The Majesty DVD set also contains a second disc with live performances and video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uI16Eay9PY3huAko49uEusfgiKS.jpg", "actors": ["The Black Dahlia Murder (The Black Dahlia Murder)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
