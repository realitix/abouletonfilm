Stewart), a man suffering from Cerebal Palsy, who spends his days wasting away in a nursing home. To pass his time, he fantasizes about the man he should be despite his twisted body. People are able to understand him verbally, women find him irresistable, and his is a legitimate threat to anyone who stands in his way. His thoughts deatil four possible relationships he would have and their various outcomes. At one point, he receives (unsimulated) fellatio from another handicapped patient. Very sexual film that has it's moments of humor despite the seriousness of the topic - a perfectly \"normal\" mind trapped in twisted flesh that cannot communicate normally with the outside world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i8WgmsRHN3cqp5GawTn9TACG4ig.jpg", "actors": ["Steven C.
