Montages of color move rapidly with a star and the edge of a lighted moon briefly visible. Purgation is back to full frame; blurs of color occasionally slow down then freeze. From time to time, an image, such as a window or a face, is distinguishable for a moment. In \"existence is song,\" colors swirl then flash in and out of view. Behind the vivid colors are momentary glimpses of volcanic activity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gGgbDE5sdc5qpmo4lLkevqA0Au1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [126193, 126197, 126204, 104407], "youtube_key": "JVbvWEYgsRE"}
