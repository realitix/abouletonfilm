Thus, after a few titles explaining the impact that gold mining has had on the country's Amazon region, along with helicopter footage (later to be blended into the narrative) of the ecologically devastated area, the film settles in on the lawless shanty town of Payapal for its narrative. Gallego (Armando Gota) runs the mine, exploiting his cheap labor force. Aroldo (Pedro Lander) breaks into Gallego's safe and steals his gold, along with a good deal of gold that Gallego was holding for his workers. Aroldo involves the unwitting Carmen (Jenny Noguera) in the robbery, and, when they are discovered, he shoots and kills Gallego's young son.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aRwQE4obuBIybMNx0NnEvSv2LHX.jpg", "actors": ["Laureano Olivares (Cae)", "Roc\u00edo Miranda (Isabel)", "Armando Gota (Gallego)", "Pedro Lander ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
