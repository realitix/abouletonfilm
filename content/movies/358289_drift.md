{"tmdb_id": 358289, "title": "Drift", "original_title": "Drift", "slug_title": "drift", "date": "1994-01-02", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "The overall feel of Drift is sombre and mysterious; a study of winter light falling on the surface of water, metal and cloud. The dominant colour is grey; grey infused with a multitude of ocean blues and greens. There is little land in this film and very few landmarks from which to navigate from one space to the next. The picture plane is in continuous motion like the ocean which, on the surface at least, is the subject of Drift.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hgxlxQFStGVYuso7W2Wj1nGHk90.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
