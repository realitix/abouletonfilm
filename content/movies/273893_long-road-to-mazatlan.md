Shot in and around San Antonio, it mixes familiar images of the West\u2014the cowboy, the cattle yard, the dirt road\u2014with a more contemporary and homoerotic iconography, unsettling each one. A tale of frustration and loss, the work offers no prescription for stable identity or for the satisfaction of desire, but the sensuality of its images and form is hearteningly seductive.
