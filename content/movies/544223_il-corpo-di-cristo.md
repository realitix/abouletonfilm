Realized a year later and screened at the Bellaria Film Festival, Akab brings his very personal cartoon style on the screen, without an explicitly splattered violence but suggested by a dirty and dramatic direction, filmed with an old video camera and a frenetic editing. Always with an underground style and with the strong contrasts that recall the chine of his graphic-novel.  The typical day of an atypical family. A family that is so religious as to become cannibal. The commandment is divine: \"Eat yourself\" .Take and eat my body: an exasperated form up to its litterature. that brings whites to eat the white meat and to avoid, perpaura of obscure contaminations, even the fucking Martians. Not recommended for all religious fundamentalists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kBKA8cp2TgagWTtRzlAUZKaBULN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
