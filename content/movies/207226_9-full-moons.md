Frankie (Amy Seimetz) is an emotional train wreck, careening around the East Los Angeles music scene drinking and meeting strangers. Lev (Bret Roberts) is a taciturn and tormented soul. He drives a limo and wants to work in the music business. They begin a relationship after they connect with each other one night at a party. This dark romance explores what love is like for two quiet people who may be damaged beyond repair. Lev gets to explore his musical dreams working for star Charlie King Nash (Donal Logue) and learn about the practical realities that restrain talent to make artistic dreams so complicated and frustrating. Together Frankie and Lev explore the challenges of a serious relationship, trying to determine if it's something either of them can handle. This moody piece goes beyond romantic movie clich\u00e9s to explore the intricate interactions of two lovers who don't fit into any neat categorizations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/laz9k9ElvNeFcY4U4DoZOpiPISX.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Dean Stanton (Dimitri)", "Bret Roberts (Lev)", "Amy Seimetz (Frankie)", "Donal Logue (Charlie King Nash)", "Brian McGuire (Ronnie)", "Foster Timms (Spencer Walsh)", "James Duval (Terry)", "Dale Dickey (Billie)", "Twink Caplan (Anna)", "Al Sapienza (Dr. Phelps)", "Tipper Newton (Sadie)", "Chrissy Randall (Serafina)", "Joey Capone (Sam)", "Pamela Adlon (Rachel Stevens)", "Kingston Rumi Southwick (Josh Stevens)", "Uri Averbuch (Uri: Car Service Manager)", "Chriso Dimassis (Mike)", "Chis Ivan Cevic (Jon)", "Logan Sparks (Ian)", "Jordan Harkins (Flyers club-boy)", "Daniel Gamburg (Victor)", "Christina Harmon (Waitress)", "Dru Morgan (Lobo)", "Rose Marie Smith (Woman at the park)", "Alex Patten (Man at the park)", "Shane Almagor (Shane)", "David Mander (Gun Specialist)", "Teri Mokrani (Kitty)", "Farah Mokrani (Bella)", "Lauren Royce (Diva)", "Corby Griesenbeck (Toby Crosby)", "Max Barsness (Corby Crosby)", "Natalie Kabenjian (Lesbian barfly)", "Garr Godfrey (Park Ranger)", "Brad Detanna (Dr. D)", "Melissa LeEllen (Anesthesiologist)", "Griffin Kramer (mandy's son)", "Danny Minnick (Donny)", "Sunny (Ranch Dog)", "Jerry Dmytryk (Older dancer: Jerry)", "Stephan Schubert (Adam: painter in the bar)", "Jason Groman (Brian: businessman at the bar)", "Andrew Boutilier (Businessman at the bar)", "John Markland (Omar: bartender)", "DJ Roman (DJ)", "Johnny Moezzi (Guitarist onstage)", "Frank Bensoussan (Bouncer)", "Beth Fryman (Bar Girl)", "Lorielle New (Lorielle)", "Annie Gaia (Dimples Monroe)", "Gabrielle Almagor (Yard Sale Mom)", "Iris Bahr (Keren)", "Morty Coyle (Jack - AA Moderator)", "James Darling (Party Guest)", "Davie-Blue (Noel - Magazine Photographer)", "Christo Dimassis (Mike)", "Jade Dornfeld (Mandy)", "Michael Frost (Lucian)", "Elana Krausz (Grace)", "Tara Loughran (Raver)", "Brad Southwick (Jim Rose)", "Shahrnaz Nancy Southwick (Kim Rose)", "Fernanda Ulibarri (Marianne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
