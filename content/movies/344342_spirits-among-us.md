Strange things begin to happen, first just annoying, then becoming terrifying. Television sets go on and off by themselves, strange noises in the attic, movement in the shadows, light bulbs bursting, unexplained voices, terrifying dreams, and dolls that seem to have a mind of their own. Being a self-sufficient independent do-it-yourself kind of man, Mark tries to \"fix it\" with his own resources. Only after being brought to near death does he realize he needs the power of the Holy Spirit through the authority of Jesus Christ to rid their home of this malevolent spirits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5L3NVojE0BuaGkGtpWbMBe4LhQ2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
