What passes for \"antics\" ensues when Sally's husband George arrives, has sex with her while Jack hides in the closet, and Jack flees undetected at an opportune moment.  His misery is just beginning as a jailbait next-door neighbor Julie accosts him, threatening to blow the whistle unless he makes love to her. Afterwards she tells him she's a 14-year-old, and while he ponders his faux pas her Aunt Lily shows up with a gun. She lets him down easy, revealing that Julie is actually 18, but that Julie's her daughter. Jack is forced to make love (in various positions) to Ma Lily, and then comes the coup de grace -he's locked in a room with Keith, who's been Lily & Julie's prisoner for six months.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e41IueCz94uucKsH3IsthNcleeO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
