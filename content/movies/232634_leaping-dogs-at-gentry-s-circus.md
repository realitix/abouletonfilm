Greyhounds leap in rapid succession, forming a graceful arch and landing on the ground as lightly as so many feathers. The position of the camera was a most happy one, as the dogs appeared to leap directly toward the audience and the film is both beautiful and exciting.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
