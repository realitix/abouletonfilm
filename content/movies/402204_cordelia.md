When he is found dead, all of the suspicion is directed towards the liberal woman. She is judged more for her morality then for the crime she is accused of. Her culpability is still a subject of debate today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/26qjixEY66X3H5kEso8sbUly7KD.jpg", "actors": ["Louise Portal (Cord\u00e9lia Viau)", "Gaston Lepage (Samuel Paslow)", "Raymond Cloutier (Me Jos Fortier)", "Gilbert Sicotte (Me Jean-Dominique Leduc)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
