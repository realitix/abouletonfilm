It gets to relax, unwind, and avoid a trip to the slaughterhouse - at least for a few days. Of course, it couldn\u2019t imagine the menagerie of madmen it would run into. Down the hall is a pair of drug addled dimwits who are desperate for something to eat. The cow becomes their main focus. Meanwhile, two different spree killers are wrecking havoc. One murders at the command of some erroneous bath linen. The other listens to a voice inside his shoe, the instructions resulting in even more dead bodies. All the while, our contented animal tries to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs, which typically revolve around a room service meal of meat and potatoes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t3JUnbqYspDirdlDyzune8J4zDn.jpg", "actors": ["Giuseppe Andrews ()", "Walt Dongo ()", "Miles Dougal ()", "Tiffany Naylor ()", "Vietnam Ron ()", "Bill Tyree ()", "Bill Nowlin ()", "Walter Patterson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
