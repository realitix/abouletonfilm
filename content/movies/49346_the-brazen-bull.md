Set in the bowels of an iconic derelict Los Angeles high-rise, we follow Lauren and her real-estate investing fianc\u00e9 as they discover first hand what happens when a madman leads not with emotion, but rather chilling rationality. The Man in question brings a heaping helping of sanity and jet-black humor to the crazy table. The result is a wonderfully off-kilter horror/thriller that never goes where we expect, but rather draws the audience deeper into a surprising world that has dark corners even in the brightest rooms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fFbFJXwLFAuOqzG47xDnwKUx41R.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Madsen ()", "Jennifer Tisdale ()", "Rachel Hunter ()", "Gwendolyn Garver ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
