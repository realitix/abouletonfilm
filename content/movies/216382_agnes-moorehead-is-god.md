There is much power in silence and our talkie seeks to show this. These two ladies had a real, or reel, rivalry...not as virulent as the one between Bette and Joan...but quite toxic, just the same. Why did they hate each other SO much?? They were very similar in many ways. Both came from humble backgrounds, rising to the top through sheer force of will. Both were locked in awful marriages to abusive alcoholics...both had foster sons who simply vanished from their lives...you would think that they would have been friends. And yet, they hated each other. Maybe they had actually loved each other...once.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
