Massimo is also involved with drugs and he sometimes steals to make a living and support his habit (the theft of a tobacco box is very important to the story). Among his associates are his girlfriend, Cinzia, who comes from a wealthy family, and he has a wealthy male friend named Rudy who is very naive as well as strangely pampered by his overly-doting mother. Both families don't approve of their relationship with Massimo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8KbHK46Jo0FZ3CDsEfbIU6X6XRK.jpg", "actors": ["Bud Cort (Massimo Monaldi)", "Marcel Bozzuffi (Commissario De Stefani)", "Eva Czemerys (Rudy's Mother)", "Maurizio Arena ()", "Annarita Grapputo (Cinzia)", "Guido Alberti (Police Captain)", "Gianfilippo Carcano ()", "Ennio Balbo ()", "Umberto Raho (Giovanni)", "Mico Cundari ()", "Pupo De Luca ()", "Patrizia Gori ()", "Tom Felleghy ()", "Anna Zinnemann ()", "Leopoldo Trieste ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
