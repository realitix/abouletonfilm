That tendency, nurtured by the filmmakers carefully crafted succession of visual teases and exploited by the camera's ability to become our eyes, becomes in increasingly evident as the film progresses. The camera teases the viewer, in this case, co-voyeur, not with sexual or erotic innuendo, but rather with graphic and aesthetic challenges. The partially opened window of a woman's dressing room forces us to realize our urge to see more about these hidden worlds. This type of cinematically- induced self- realization makes Voyeuristic Tendencies a powerfully human film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
