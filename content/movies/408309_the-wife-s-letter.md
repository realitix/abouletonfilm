Here, the protagonist named X is the personified variable in Mathematics who is suffering from schizophrenia and hence, his personality is not constant and varies. In this story, a LEAF has been considered to be a constant and X must be equal to that LEAF in order to validate language. This is an attempt to prove that Mathematics does not constitute emotions, sentiments and is comprising mere calculations; however, one's life cannot be completely manipulated.  Here, the protagonist travels through three worlds to discover himself trying to equate himself to the LEAF.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iIaX8cRLsiQEywrZFtpb7hBM1mI.jpg", "actors": ["Kaushik Roy ()", "Sanchari Dutta ()", "Diganta S.
