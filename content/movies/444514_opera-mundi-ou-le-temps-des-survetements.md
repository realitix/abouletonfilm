Grab moments of reality, following your desires, without first judging the coherence of the whole. Wander. Trust the pictures - and the sounds. Slowly, confront the first pieces and discover what your desires meant. Put aside certain shots that don't fit. Shoot more; complete the composition, trying not to reduce it to a story. Reconsider the elements you left aside. Keep going. The \u00abreally upside-down world\u00bb stands behind our eyes. Each of us is a social body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6k7CeZoTMOnp88haQdhXRDbcQGA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
