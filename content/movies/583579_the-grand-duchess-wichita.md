Offenbach\u2019s operettas inspired and influenced the works of Johann Strauss, Jr. and Arthur Sullivan. So, even though his works are less familiar in the United States, fans of \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d or \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance\u201d will likely find this amusing work familiar territory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ReYOZHEMjng0T0gqS98EdG5LIT.jpg", "actors": ["Kaitlyn Costello ()", "Cullen Gandy ()", "William Powers ()", "Alyssa Toepfer ()", "Brian Frutiger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
