Britain was in the grip of an IRA bombing campaign; a future prime minister was beginning to make her mark on a middle England in which punk was yet to run amok; and a young Cambridge graduate called Geoff Travis opened a new shop at 202 Kensington Park Road, just off Ladbroke Grove in west London. The Rough Trade shop sold obscure and challenging records by bands like American art-rockers Pere Ubu, offering an alternative to the middle-of-the-road rock music that dominated the music business.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2eMIEySAEMHx5JynxwM4HwZ0Ex9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
