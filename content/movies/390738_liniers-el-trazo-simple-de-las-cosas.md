Two artists from Argentina receive a grant to develop their work in Montreal (Canada). The only catch? They have to share an apartment. In this way filmmaker Franca Gonz\u00e1lez and cartoonist Ricardo Siri Liniers come to know each other. From the moment Gonz\u00e1lez becomes the roommate of Liniers, a friendship emerges between them and she makes him the proposal of doing a documentary about him.  The film starts with an argument to get Liniers permission to chase him with videocameras and ends up becoming one of the most tender portraits ever done of the artist, reflecting the transcendence that ensues from the simple line of his drawings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Rsi3D62tDy6a5UfLr4F71HLnu9.jpg", "actors": ["Liniers (Liniers)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ralsHyvv8rk"}
