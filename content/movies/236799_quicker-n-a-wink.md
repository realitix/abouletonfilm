Edgerton demonstrates stroboscopic photography, which he helped develop. This process allows us to see in slow motion what happens during events that occur too fast to be seen by the naked eye. Examples shown here include a bullet in flight as it shatters a light bulb, the moment of impact when a kicker kicks a football, and the motion of a hummingbird's wings as it hovers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4AAiIOPGeQqigAE3IenJnCNbyNk.jpg", "actors": ["Pete Smith (Narrator (voice))", "Harold E.
