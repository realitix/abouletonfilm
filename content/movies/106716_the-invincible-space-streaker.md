Adults are hard to control so he lures a group of boys to his lab. He doesn't quite have the hang of it and after several failures gets it working properly on Hsiao Po. The process is interrupted when Hsiao Wen takes a piss on the control panel. The boys escape and the process is eventually completed by the evil scientist's good brother, and we have our superhero. What follows is a group sing-a-long at an amusement park, motorcycle chases and fights between our hero and lots of bad guys in ridiculous costumes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cwIEnYqAl43QmQJYw6BXAfYY2hJ.jpg", "actors": ["Chen Pei-ling (Mrs. Lin)", "Lin Hsiao-Hu (Shao Po)", "Wu Yu-Kang (Hsiao Wen)", "Ming Chun Li ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
