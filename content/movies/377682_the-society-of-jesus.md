The Jesuits spread their influence in Central Europe. Maria, a young Countess lives in the castle. Father Had is a honest and ardent servant of the Society of Jesus. He is dedicated to his life's mission, and as such he is an ideal tool in the hands of his superiors, who have their own plans. Had becomes Maria's confessor. Her woman's charm, intelligence and energy, as well as her beauty, are a constant temptation to him. Jesuits are making pressure on Had to finally realize their plans. Will the Jesuits, at last, achieve their goals and take the castle?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/993Ork5A0VNYh3BJN76wJL40zzp.jpg", "actors": ["Milan Ple\u0161tina (Father Had)", "Leona Paraminski (Countess Maria)", "Ivica Vidovi\u0107 (Father Ivan)", "Ma\u0161a Petranovi\u0107 (Countess's Daughter)", "Mustafa Nadarevi\u0107 (Castelan)", "Matija Prskalo (Castelan's Wife)", "Galiano Pahor (Provincial)", "Darko Milas (Rector)", "Livio Badurina (Archbishop)", "Bojan Navojec (Ba\u010dvar)", "Dejan A\u0107imovi\u0107 (Abot)", "Leon Lu\u010dev (Vojnik)", "Zoran \u010cubrilo (Admontor)", "Vlatko Duli\u0107 (Seljak)", "Kre\u0161imir Miki\u0107 (Zabavlja\u010d Sefard)", "Jagoda Kaloper (Zabavlja\u010dica Sefard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
