It occurs a month after A Night At The Opera was released and soon after it hit number one and was video taped for The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted by Bob Harris for BBC television. Most of the show was taped, but the BBC cameras were turned off when Queen came back onstage after the \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d encore to play a few more songs. The cameramen couldn\u2019t capture this part of the show so after thirty-five years it remains unseen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pKiyqoiCO4nofvAtkpW6IaMmTFl.jpg", "actors": ["Freddie Mercury ()", "Brian May ()", "Roger Taylor ()", "John Deacon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
