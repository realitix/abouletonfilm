Made in homage to Miyazawa Kenji's classic novel, Milky Way Railroad, the story evolves around the spiritual journey of a young woman, in the company of her best friend and a little boy, into a world of rich in-between realities. Their venture into and out of the land of \"awakened dreams\" occurs during a long ride on a night train. The filmmaker elegantly depicts each encounter in two-dimensional space with a unique artistic gesture and ingeniously frames the passage as a series of rhythmic image sequensces as seen through the window of a train.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2i8DcW8biPRsLl4IAbzwJ4yjfYw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
