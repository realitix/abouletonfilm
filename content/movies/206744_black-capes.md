The action begins in a tavern where a group of former students are reminiscing about their time at the university. One of the students, Jose Duarte then breaks into song, performing an impromptu fado in the local Coimbra style. The tavern owner's niece, the aptly named Maria Lisboa promptly retaliates with a fado of the Lisbon variety. The melodramatic plot then centers on the frustrated romance between these two characters, and the soundtrack is essentially a musical duel between these two different styles of Portugal's national song.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ivywZvvpvCn8JfQZrlR3R9UJn9e.jpg", "actors": ["Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues (Maria de Lisboa)", "Alberto Ribeiro (Jos\u00e9 Duarte)", "Artur Agostinho (Manecas)", "Vasco Morgado (Jorge)", "Barroso Lopes (Coca-Bichinhos)", "Humberto Madeira (J\u00e1-C\u00e1-Canta)", "Ant\u00f3nio Sacramento (Juiz)", "Fernando Silva (Cunha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
