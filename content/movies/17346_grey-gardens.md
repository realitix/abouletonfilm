Edie Bouvier Beale and her mother, Edith, are the sole inhabitants of a Long Island estate. During the course of the documentary, they discuss their habits, desires and former loves with filmmakers Albert and David Maysles. The women reveal themselves to be misfits with outsized, engaging personalities. Much of the conversation is centered on their pasts, as mother and daughter now rarely leave home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jw1qTQX8pWUM8XFGbhM7A5mpmG9.jpg", "actors": ["Edith Bouvier Beale (Herself)", "Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (Herself)", "Brooks Hyers (Herself)", "Norman Vincent Peale (Herself)", "Jack Helmuth (Himself (uncredited))", "Albert Maysles (Himself (uncredited))", "David Maysles (Himself (uncredited))", "Jerry Torre (Himself (uncredited))", "Lois Wright (Herself (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [27375, 47491, 57657, 93655], "youtube_key": "mumWYU5aHBU"}
