Ricky is a minstrel with a geologist degree while Pete is a subdued mechanical genius and inventor, albeit penniless. They find sanctuary in a desert mining town.\r\n\r\nThis decent Australian production from 1988 is not a comedy as touted; it\u2019s a semi-offbeat drama with some amusing touches. It\u2019s reminiscent of flicks like \u201cJoyride\u201d (1977) with Anne Lockhart & Melanie Griffith about youths fleeing the big city and their misadventures trying out a new life in the vast wilderness (not to be confused with the 2001 road rage flick \u201cJoy Ride\u201d).\r\n\r\nNina Landis comes across as a plain Jane at first, but grows more alluring as the movie proceeds, particularly when she\u2019s in tight jeans later in the story (just kidding, not really). Tetchie Agbayani is also on hand on the feminine front, a kinda cute Asian. The guy who plays Pete looks like an Aussie version of Charlie Sheen.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, \u201cRikky and Pete\u201d may not be great, but it ain\u2019t bad either, particularly if you\u2019re in the mood for a quirky misadventure flick like \u201cJoyride\u201d (1977).\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot in Australia (New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": []}
