Randozza, a beefy and gay Chicago cop. One night, as he's leaving a bar with his lover, a gang of high-school punks with baseball bats decide to do some \"fag-bashing\". Tony's gun cools them off, and after giving them a brutally verbal dressing down, he forces the leader of the gang, the leather-jacketed Jimmy, to come to his house the next night for dinner. Jimmy shows up, frightened out of his wits, and in a wild scene that includes Eileen Brennan as Tony's ditzy mother, the young tough gets a harsh lesson in sexual tolerance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aBkLEaHiOBFiaBha8bw6J0Bnk11.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
