He quit because he didn\u2019t agree any longer with their policy of treating those creatures like slaves. Cesare stands up for their life, when the Doge of Venice decides to destroy them when it became politically convenient. Cesare\u2019s determination doesn\u2019t only lay in protecting human rights. He believes that they can still feel emotion and, possibly one day, talk. His dear Amanda was turned into a Returnee few years ago, but Cesare always refused treating her like a dog with rabies. When the Doge is about to press the button that will annihilate every Returnee in Venice, Cesare will interfere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vSE7VGxd5qIANAOxm64JhhVxbQ8.jpg", "actors": ["Marco Canadea (Cesare)", "Francesca Bruni (Giulia)", "Gino Picciano (The Doge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
