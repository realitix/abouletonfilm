Ces trois Afro-Am\u00e9ricaines travaillaient pour la NASA et ont permis \u00e0 l\u2019astronaute John Glenn de r\u00e9aliser son premier vol en orbite, tout juste 10 mois apr\u00e8s le Russe Yuri Gagarine. Cet exploit a redonn\u00e9 confiance \u00e0 l\u2019Am\u00e9rique et a relanc\u00e9 la course \u00e0 l\u2019espace entre les deux grandes puissances politiques de l\u2019\u00e9poque.

Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.\r\n\r\nThe film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.\r\n\r\nThe others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!\r\n\r\n_8/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [334543, 376867, 393457, 376866], "youtube_key": "5wfrDhgUMGI"}
