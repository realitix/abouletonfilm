Every history is an arrangement of silent testimonies and discursive traces allowing us to be where we were not.

An exploration of the history of a place as a poem of history; a history of a presence as the presence of all histories.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
