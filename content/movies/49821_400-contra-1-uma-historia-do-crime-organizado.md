It shows him living together with the political prisoners incurred under the same National Security Law and his leadership in the Ilha Grande Prison creating a type of unheard of conduct and solidarity in the Brazilian prisons. The film goes on to tell of the group's actions on the streets of Rio de Janeiro during the beginning of the 80s when they irritated the police with their daring robberies, as well as portraying the surprising love story between William and Tereza. The narrative weaves its way between the intimate conflict and the spectacular assaults and escapes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1bWSLYjds7Telmd8Z2KgkVIGG14.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel de Oliveira (William)", "Daniela Escobar (Teresa)", "Fabr\u00edcio Boliveira (Cavanha)", "Negra Li (Geni)", "Jefferson Brasil (Biro)", "Jonathan Azevedo (Baiano)", "Lui Mendes (Maranh\u00e3o)", "Lui Brites (Nazareth)", "Rodrigo Brassoloto (Neco)", "Branca Messina (Carmen)", "Paulo Letier (Alo\u00edsio)", "Marcelo Zulian (Esqueleto)", "Luiz Bertazzo (PC)", "Edu Regnier (Queiroz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [479871], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
