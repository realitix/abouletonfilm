Even with local auto factories closing down and jobs being lost, the town's residents continue to flock to the local speedway every Friday night--and its drivers continue to pour their dwindling resources into their Thundercars. Emmy(R)-winning filmmaker Jon Alpert presents this look at this passion for racing in rust-belt America. Since the closing of a GM plant and the loss of 33,000 jobs, the once-thriving town of Anderson now stands witness to empty factories, shuttered stores and abandoned home--but also to packed houses at Anderson Speedway where people put their troubles on hold to watch the cacophony of screeching tires and crashing metal as drivers vie for Thundercar supremacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/92N5XETpauQJO5Pln2S26Nr5uRr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
