When she returns from a trip abroad, Tsumura, Kosaku's assistant, meets her and takes Saori to an apartment. There, Tsumura rapes her and submits her to various sexual tortures while she is photographed by photo-journalist Tayama. Saori's husband Kosaku uses the photographs to blackmail her into giving him control of the family estate. Saori is returned to her mansion, but kept in a cage in the basement where she is subjected to regular bouts of abuse from Tsumura. Besides rape, other indignities endured by Lady Saori include breast bondage, enemas and the insertion of hen's eggs into her vagina. After Kosaku dies from a stroke, Saori realizes that she has come to enjoy Tsumura's treatment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bdlSL1KvKcKf49uso2gPxbwNQOc.jpg", "actors": ["Naomi Tani (Saori Nanbara)", "Haruka Tajima (Aiko Sagara)", "Keijir\u014d Shiga (Hideo Tsumura)", "Mami Yuki (Mitsuko Tsumura)", "Tessh\u014d Furukawa (Hiroyuki Tayama)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
