Bright spot lights dot the night, sometimes shining on her window. She sharpens pencils and writes on a page in a copy book. The pencil point often breaks under her fingers' force. She places broken points outside the window on the sill. A satanic figure is somewhere nearby, animated but of straw or clay, not flesh. She finishes her writing, tears the paper from the pad, folds it, places it in an envelope, and slips it through a slot. Is she writing to her husband? \"Sweetheart, come.\" Written by", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gSeTuBO84IqQJSEY7CbpRYtiW46.jpg", "actors": ["Marlene Kaminsky (Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [19009, 59357, 59355, 59360], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
