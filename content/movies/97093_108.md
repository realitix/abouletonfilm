The search for the traces of his life leads to the discovery that in the eighties in Paraguay, under Stroessner's dictatorship, Rodolfo was included in one of the \"108 lists of homosexuals\", arrested and tortured. Rodolfo's story reveals a part of the hidden and silenced history of my country. In \"Cuchillo de palo\" two generations come face to face in a confrontation that ultimately allows each of us to understand our place in the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uo5Ok8TdBTYqFJ7xoJkD74iRTF5.jpg", "actors": ["Miguel Auad Petunia (Himself)", "Renate Costa (Herself)", "Manuel Cuenca (Himself)", "Nancy Baruja (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AVQyiGCu9ZU"}
