Lawrence's simmering tale of sex, love, and family. In the years leading up to World War I, the problems faced by many families were uncannily similar to the issues that mankind would still be struggling with nearly a century later. Human relationships remain as fragile as ever, and the only constant in life seems to be a humbling sense of uncertainty. Sarah Lancashire stars in a drama detailing the anguish of first love, and the awkward confusion of first sex.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvf5GNzGIQPaBFJagSzQArgFgzo.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Lancashire (Gertrude Morel)", "Hugo Speer (Walter Morel)", "James Murray (William Morel)", "Rupert Evans (Paul Morel)", "Esther Hall (Clara Dawes)", "Lyndsey Marshal (Miriam Leivers)", "Matthew Beard (Young Paul)", "Brittany Ashworth (Young Miriam)", "Robert Angell (Station Porter)", "Heather Bleasdale (Mrs. Anthony)", "Stephen Boxer (Specialist)", "Katherine Kelly (Suffragette Speaker - Emily)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "raistlin3", "content": "A wonderful piece of filmmaking set to a beautiful score. D.H. Lawrence will certainly warrant some reading on my part. Rupert Evans looks a lot like a young Brad Pitt here.
