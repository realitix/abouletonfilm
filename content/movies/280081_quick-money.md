Smythe, who has made it big in the big city, has returned to his small hometown of Glenwood after being away for twenty years. Accompanying him is his personal secretary, Ambrose Ames. Despite it being purely a vacation to get some rest and relaxation, the leading citizens of the town welcome him back with some official gatherings. Mayor Jonas Tompkins, who never liked Bluford, holds no grudges against him and too welcomes him with open arms. Although Bluford had no intention of making the news public, the townsfolk learn that he has indeed come back to do business, specifically develop a summer resort in Glenwood to rival that of the best summer resorts worldwide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kIFWMfaKAswgc0epoklfUyAZWJ4.jpg", "actors": ["Fred Stone (Mayor Jonas Tompkins)", "Gordon Jones (Bill Adams)", "Dorothy Moore (Alice Tompkins)", "Berton Churchill (Bluford H.
