What emerges is an elegant meditation on the relationship between truth and the camera frame, as Johnson transforms scenes that have been presented on Festival screens as one kind of truth into another kind of story\u2014one about personal journey, craft, and direct human connection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/de3EPesgdG0S4rw8WzXWRDZoBH0.jpg", "actors": ["Kirsten Johnson (Herself (archive footage))", "Jacques Derrida (Himself (archive footage))", "Michael Moore (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [310799, 101740, 108831, 149507], "youtube_key": "179496166"}
