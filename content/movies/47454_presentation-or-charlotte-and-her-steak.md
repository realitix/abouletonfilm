Walter introduces Charlotte to Clara, hoping to make Charlotte jealous. After saying good-bye to Clara, Walter accompanies Charlotte into her house, although she doesn't want him to. Charlotte is hungry and cooks a steak. She asks Walter if he wants a piece of it. He says no, but she gives him a small piece anyway. He wants a kiss, and she says no. She starts to compare herself with Clara, who Walter agrees is more beautiful. In spite of this, Walter says he likes Charlotte much more, but she thinks he is lying. She notices that he is cold and shivering. She hugs him, he kisses her, and she starts kissing him. After leaving the house he accompanies her to the train.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96jT4Rr5J5N4q1ucPVHLdhVzXVW.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Luc Godard (Walter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
