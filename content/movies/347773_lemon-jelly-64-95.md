Taking full advantage of the increased audio capabilities of the DVD format each track is also remixed for full 5.1 surround sound.  Each track has its own video with a unique visual style. Much like the audio however while many of the visuals are exactly what you'd expect from a Lemon Jelly release some are very different to anything we've seen before.  Although the DVD itself is devoid of special features, contained in the specially created packaging are 4 postcards and a large (A1 sized) double-sided poster.  The DVD can be played as a movie (i.e. as a sequential play through of all the tracks in album order) or as individual tracks.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
