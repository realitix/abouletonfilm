Today few remain. Filmmaker Michael Dominic takes his camera behind the doors of the Sunshine Hotel, one of the few remaining affordable refuges for the destitute and out of luck, a world that has seemingly stood still for more than eight decades. Here the hotel residents live in tiny four-by-six-foot cubicles crowned by a ceiling of chicken wire. Focusing on several of the Sunshine\u2019s denizens \u2013 including a drag queen saving all his money for plastic surgery and a hotel manager who doubles as its resident philosopher \u2013 Dominic presents a non-judgmental snapshot of a diverse group of characters as memorable as the characters at Harry Hope\u2019s bar in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s \u201cThe Iceman Cometh.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tsCUey8zDlzZhHsWQLGQiZKL1pR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
