A riotous black comedy that's as timely today as ever, it contrasts the appalling conditions in a overcrowded London hospital with a soap opera playing on the televisions there. In an ingenious touch, the same actors appear in the \"real\" story as well as the \"TV\" one, thus blurring the distinctions even further. Jack Gould directs such outstanding British actors as Lynn Redgrave, Colin Blakely, Eleanor Bron, Jim Dale, Donald Sinden, Mervyn Johns, and, in only his second film, Bob Hoskins. The renowned Carl Davis composed the score.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8xuZcUr64R1jhTBSk9Uxa5WmFHn.jpg", "actors": ["Lynn Redgrave (Nurse Sweet / Nurse Betty Martin)", "Eleanor Bron (Mr. Carr / Senior Surgeon Boyd)", "Jim Dale (Barnet / Dr. Neil Boyd)", "Donald Sinden (Mr. Carr / Senior Surgeon Boyd)", "Mervyn Johns (Rees)", "Bob Hoskins (Foster)", "Colin Blakely (Edward Loach)", "Sheila Scott-Wilkenson (Nurse Powell / Cleo Norton)", "Neville Aurelius ()", "Gillian Barge ()", "George Browne ()", "James Hazeldine ()", "Patience Collier ()", "Mervyn Johns ()", "Clive Swift ()", "Maureen Pryor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
