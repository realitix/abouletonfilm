All of the films are connected by a common theme: the places, that for our crew, were out of the ordinary. We basically tried to avoid as many of the \"Big Name\" waters, hatches and fishing grounds as we could. We do visit a few regions that are by no means off the beaten path, but try to show them in a different light. All said and done the DVD boasts over two hours of fly fishing content", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/44BrvfGhzIQ26VrClIOeqFsMz2V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
