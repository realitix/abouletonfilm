This legendary production starring Cesare Siepi in the title role with Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler conducting was  filmed in Salzburg\u2019s open-air Felsenreitschule theatre during the 1954 Salzburg Festival. Although the production is clearly dated, it remains a must-see for lovers of the opera, both as a historical document of a vintage, all-star production and simply as an excellent way to experience Mozart\u2019s masterpiece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uJfZbDkF7Wde9cYbBz4XjpUXdm.jpg", "actors": ["Cesare Siepi (Don Giovanni)", "Desz\u00f6 Ernster (Il Commendatore)", "Elisabeth Gr\u00fcmmer (Donna Anna)", "Anton Dermota (Don Ottavio)", "Lisa Della Casa (Donna Elvira)", "Otto Edelmann (Leporello)", "Erna Berger (Zerlina)", "Walter Berry (Masetto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
