Iconic performers Bill Margold, Tyler Reynolds and Con Covert stir up all manner of naughty behavior, with a sprinkle of John Holmes. The story of a candy factory that avoids a hostile takeover through a revolutionary new lollipop gets about as much disinterest from the filmmakers as it probably will from you. But with the miracle of 3-D, you'll be close enough to taste the action! The Pasadena Courier says \"3-D is what makes the film a riot. One can't help but crack-up at the various body parts that appear to be jiggling, bouncing, dangling and squirting right off the screen.\" 3-D glasses provided. Also known as M3-D: The Movie. Directed by Stephen Gibson (credited as Norm De Plume).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oQEsNFBzB8SP7GrHYJblMXpA3Fp.jpg", "actors": ["John Holmes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
