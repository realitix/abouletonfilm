Set in the city of Hangzhou (where Yang had studied at the China Academy of Fine Art), the film takes as its focal point a restless young man, Zhu Zi, following him as he aimlessly wanders through the city. Through a series of distinct vignettes, Yang depicts Zhu Zi's inability to find comfort in friends, lovers or environment as a reflection of the existential difficulty of China's \"nameless generation,\" cast adrift during the rapid changes at the turn of the millennium.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rezgY1NgrehCWqxoLYdxV2aKme3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
