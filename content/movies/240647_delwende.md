While this happens, her husband feels disgraced that Diarrha resists the idea of marrying off their daughter, so he exactes his revenge by spreading a dangerous rumor that would probably get her killed. Because of this, Diarrha's fate falls into the village elder's hands. When she finds out she will go trial, she decides to flee to the nearest town, Ouagadougou, before that can take place. After successfully leaving her village, Diarrha's age causes her health to decline, while her daughter grows up. Some time later, her daughter decides to travel to Ouagadougou, in search of her missing mother. Once they are reconnected, they attempt to escape from their male-dominated society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7WafMPOEQTy6PB8k5ibQ2RvUru3.jpg", "actors": ["Blandine Yam\u00e9ogo (Napoko)", "Claire Ilboudo (Pougbila)", "C\u00e9lestin Zongo (Diarra)", "Abdoulaye Komboudri (Nonceur)", "Daniel Kabor\u00e9 (Banc\u00e9, l'ancien)", "Jules Taonssa (Raogo, le devin)", "Thomas Ngourma (Elie, le fou)", "Sanfo Ablasse (Dancer / musician)", "Zounprana Boukare (Dancer / musician)", "Francois Dembele (Dancer / musician)", "Ami Kabre (Dancer / musician)", "Gilbert Lam Kabor\u00e9 (Voice on Radio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
