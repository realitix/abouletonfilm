Prone to singing in front of the mirror, smoking grass, hunting down breakfast burritos, and ranting about Ronald Reagan, Steve is decidedly not up to the task. While mostly about laughing at oneself, White and Lazy also touches on the gap between underground culture and straight society, channelling the Do It Yourself mentality of the then-soon-to-explode punk scene.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
