Bozek is working with precious material, including a lengthy 1994 filmed interview with Cunningham (shot when he received a Media Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America) and his subject\u2019s earliest pre-New York Times photographs, long unseen. In his customarily cheerful and plainspoken manner, Cunningham takes us through his Irish Catholic upbringing in Boston, his army stint, his move to New York in 1948 (which was controversial for his straitlaced family), his days as a milliner, his close friendships with Nona Park and Sophie Shonnard of Chez Ninon, his beginnings as a photographer, and his liberated and wholly democratic view of fashion. Narrated by Sarah Jessica Parker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7U2mmEBgycMzqmDuPf4PCK36tB2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
