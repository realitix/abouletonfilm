BattleGround is an irreverent journey that will challenge the orthodoxies of Left and Right, and highlight the humanity of all sides of the conflict. BattleGround will be a critical film for anyone who wants to understand the powerful forces that are sucking America deeper and deeper into a Middle Eastern quagmire. Is Iraq our generation's \"Bright Shining Lie,\" or is it the frontline in a global battle for national survival? Or is to some combination of both?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xkIhbrab0Qt9va7vh8LtTB5DwvI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
