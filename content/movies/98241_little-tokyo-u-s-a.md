Los Angeles cop Preston Foster suspects that there's dirty work afoot in the city's Japanese community, but no one will believe him except for intrepid girl reporter Brenda Joyce. When the spies frame Foster on a trumped-up murder charge, Joyce does a little detective work herself. The enemy agents are rounded up just before they can do any real damage. Because of its strident insistence that most (if not all) Japanese-American citizens were secretly loyal to the Rising Sun, Little Tokyo USA is seldom seen these days.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v8yvKWsniX3vc7LwA4NildxlIwi.jpg", "actors": ["Preston Foster (Michael Steele)", "Brenda Joyce (Maris Hanover)", "Harold Huber (Ito Takimura)", "Donald Douglas (Hendricks)", "June Duprez (Teru)", "George E.
