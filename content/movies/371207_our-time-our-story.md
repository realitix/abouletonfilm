Spearheaded in its early years by such filmmakers as Edward Yang, Ko I-cheng, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Wan Jen, the movement revitalized Taiwan cinema through low-budget experiments that emphasized personal stories, political reflection and stylistic invention. Said filmmakers, writers and actors like Wu Nien-jen and Sylvia Chang, even \"second wave\" directors Tsai Ming-liang and Lin Cheng-sheng provide fond reminiscences and retrospective insights in this compelling account of one of the most distinctive national cinemas of the last quarter-century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/owVSoeGIsJ03iUMMYzixiDZWxrl.jpg", "actors": ["Sylvia Chang (Herself)", "Hou Hsiao-hsien (Himself)", "Tsai Ming-liang (Himself)", "Ko I-Chen (Himself)", "Chang Yi (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
