For this he was reviled as a traitor and a communist in the Australian media. He had been the first journalist into Hiroshima after the atom bomb, and he covered wars in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  Filmmaker David Bradbury interviews Burchett in his later years and intercuts the interview with archival footage and still photographs. Burchett is seen in newsreel coverage and in footage taken by the North Vietnamese. Archival footage of the Vietnam War and newsreel footage of Hiroshima after the atom bomb enrich the documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aSjCMeHqj5dfSdqjiBXSFjP5OXx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
