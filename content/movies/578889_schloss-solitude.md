{"tmdb_id": 578889, "title": "Schloss Solitude", "original_title": "Schloss Solitude", "slug_title": "schloss-solitude", "date": "2002-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "\u00abI\u2019m something special\u00bb: a graceful lady in court dress declaims this sentence in the late Baroque interior of Schloss Solitude in Stuttgart. A chorus of male voices answers her from the castle stair: \u00abWe love you\u00bb. A monotonous yet grotesque litany is created, that acquires a rather neurotic note in being so repetitious. Reduction to two camera settings, which strictly track the two axes of the Baroque interior, enhances the impression. The prologue is a sequence in which a child, also in court dress, leads the viewer into this absurd scenario. In the end banality breaks into the artificially generated tension as ironic relief.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
