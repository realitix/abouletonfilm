Krzysztof Krauze's biopic My Nikifor travels to the tail end of Krynicki's (Krystyna Feldman) life journey, dramatizing the period that surrounded his interaction with the well-established artist Marian Wlosinski (Roman Gancarczyk).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7n7BVNpwXB5e2eIseNt4kp9FiKY.jpg", "actors": ["Krystyna Feldman (Nikifor)", "Roman Gancarczyk (Marian Wlosinski)", "Jerzy Gudejko (Ryszard Nowak)", "Jowita Budnik (Cleaning Lady Kowalska)", "Lucyna Malec (Hanna Wlosinska)", "Katarzyna Paczynska (Ala Wlosinska)", "Karolina Paczynska (Ewa Wlosinska)", "Artur Steranko (Doctor Rosen)", "Marian Dzi\u0119dziel (Beekeeper Ferek)", "Magdalena Cel\u00f3wna-Janikowska (Nikifor's Housekeeper)", "Ewa Wencel (Director of 'Zacheta')"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85394, 50012, 131116, 47430], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
