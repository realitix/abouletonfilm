He's practically asking for trouble when he confronts a traffic cop who explains he is looking for speeders. Woody reveals himself to be a speeder by driving to Alaska and back in less than a minute. The cop tries to arrest him but Woody states, \"I bet ya wouldn't be so tough without that uniform.\" The officer undresses but Woody attacks him with a boxing glove camera. Woody also gets his goat by dressing as a farmer on horse-and-buggy and as a Chinaboy with rickshaw. Finally, the cop flips out and is sent to a mental hospital with Woody as his caretaker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7M1WupIeqhdE8Nn3JGTzifoV3St.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Woody Woodpecker / Motorcycle Cop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
