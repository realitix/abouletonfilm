An infamous mass-murder happened there fifty years ago to the night, but that's part of the fun for the posh hotties who show up for some boozy partying. The reverie is cut short when a Raven-masked killer crashes the party, intent on repeating the bloody history of the \"Ravenwood Massacre\" that happened decades ago. As the unknown killer picks the guests off one by one, old grudges resurface among friends, and new suspicions emerge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ply1kWNfjGYL8mjOfYyZEuWmg6k.jpg", "actors": ["Andre Velts (Danny)", "Brian Stokes Mitchell (Ray)", "Litha Booi (Pembroke)", "Andr\u00e9 Dellow (The Bitchy Queens)", "Tristan McConnell (The Bitchy Queens)", "Colin Sutcliffe (Whitmore)", "Justin Mancer (Bicksley)", "Justin McGibbon (Terrance)", "Nicholas Wickstrom (Stone)", "Ivan Botha (Greg)", "Graeme Richards (Chandler)", "Traverse Le Goff (Drake)", "Rick Armando (Roderick)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
