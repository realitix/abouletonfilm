These were located along the main straight and between Turns 2 and 3, with a single detection point for both zones\u2014similar to the format trialled at the 2011 Canadian and European Grands Prix\u2014located at the entry to Turn 14. Other modifications to the circuit included the introduction of thicker, spongier astroturf on the exit of several corners to discourage drivers from driving beyond the limits of the circuit.
