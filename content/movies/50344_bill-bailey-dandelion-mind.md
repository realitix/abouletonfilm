He demonstrates new instruments, both ancient and modern, he sings an internet love song, a lament about punk heroes, Iranian hip-hop, and plays a mean folk-bouzouki. Thomas the Doubter gets a new look, and Darwin\u2019s curious obsessions and the myth of intelligent design are all worked over in Bailey\u2019s own surreal style. He revisits the music of his youth, with a brand-new French Disco re-working of Gary Numan\u2019s hit, Cars, played in his own inimitable way, and maybe some Wurzels-based remixes of classic German techno. Just your normal Bill Bailey gig, then.
