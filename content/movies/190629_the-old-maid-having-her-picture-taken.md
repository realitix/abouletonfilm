She first looks at a hanger, which immediately falls from the wall, not being able to stand her gaze. Then she looks at the clock, and her face causes it to fall to the floor with a crash. She then walks over to the mirror, which suddenly cracks in several places. The photographer then poses her. Just as he is to press the button the camera explodes with a great puff of smoke, completely destroying the camera and demolishing the studio. The picture finishes up with the old maid tipping back in her chair and losing her balance, displaying a large quantity of fancy lace goods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7M1ZJGdLDtg5dWv4gYZgbJIwTXO.jpg", "actors": ["Gilbert Saroni (The Old Maid)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [190618, 189061, 193396, 190600], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
