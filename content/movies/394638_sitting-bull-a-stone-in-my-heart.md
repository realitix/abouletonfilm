Sitting Bull\u2019s words, as portrayed by Adam Fortunate Eagle, dominate this story. Augmented by a narrator\u2019s historical perspective, over six-hundred historical photographs and images, and a compelling original music score, the film brings to life the little-known human side of Sitting Bull as well as the story of a great man\u2019s struggle to maintain his people\u2019s way of life against an ever-expanding westward movement of white settlers. It is a powerful cinematic journey into the life and spirit of a legendary figure of whom people have often heard but don\u2019t really know.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2QOiZI3veLDPqk1rd5TOnByCY2D.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Fortunate Eagle (Sitting Bull (voice))", "William Theobald (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
