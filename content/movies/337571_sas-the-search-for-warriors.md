Using the toughest military selection course in the world they are looking for the right type of solider. This is a search for warriors. 130 candidates from the cream of the military attempt the brutal 21-day trial. Most will never finish. First the candidates are subjected to constant and crushing physical exercise and torturous sleep deprivation. Their bodies are broken down - next it is their minds. Finally 39 men are still standing but they must face the fact that making it to the end does not guarantee selection. Of the 130 who arrived on day one only 26 are selected to begin training.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hwRFcY0I2NiMgJBou7DwoBavzRz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
