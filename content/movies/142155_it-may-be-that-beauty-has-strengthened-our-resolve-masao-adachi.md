A 1971 visit to a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) training camp while on the way back from Cannes resulted in Adachi's most infamous film, the agit-prop documentary Red Army/PFLP: Declaration of World War, which he co-directed with Wakamatsu. Soon after, Adachi joined a splinter cell of the Japanese Red Army in Lebanon, where he stayed from 1974 until he was deported to Japan in 1997 to serve time for passport violations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7MHcBR32jZyVdVspriVCTMwaZ0f.jpg", "actors": ["Masao Adachi (Himself)", "Naruhiko Onozawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
