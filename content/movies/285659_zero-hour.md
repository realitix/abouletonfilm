Subverting state-sponsored informational films on such issues as war bonds and highway safety, Plays transforms these agit-prop rhetorics into a celluloid mirror of transgression as a larger cultural pathology. In Zero Hour, the results - the products of war return to the initial cite of production: an assumed audience of Americans, middle-class citizens of an ideal suburban dream who have somehow foregone the immediate experiences and repercussion of mass destruction and displacement. The gaze rests on us. We are the sugar-stated, hyper and unaware violator, an audience whose relationship to world events is nowhere more homogeneous than in or communal incubation and guilt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AjWRHD2miTCP7jQJa4MXp70hDAl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
