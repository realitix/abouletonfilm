The city\u2019s peripheral architecture goes by like the setting of a retro futuristic adventure gone wrong; the governmental utopia of the housing estates, the laminated dream of the Euro Disney Park, the playgrounds and sports areas now used as spaces for getting high.

However, the youth filmed by Manon Vila is not defeated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1WKY7BPNnA4LqRRp8YZeWlqXh0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
