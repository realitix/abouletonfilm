The young woman has a hard life behind her. She was foundling, was raised by farmers. Manne, the father of her child, wanted to escape from the GDR and is in prison. After he is released, Manne wants to live again with Suse and their child together. But she rejects him as well as another worshiper. Suse is more interested in the Soviet engineer Boris, but apparently not for her, since he can never remember her at their chance encounters. But a much bigger problem - and a difficult one - is Suse, when she is offered to go to the Soviet Union for six months.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qRvMHFJ2tIKH8DF8R2piEJbLUB5.jpg", "actors": ["Irina Kiritschenko (Semjons Frau)", "Traudl Kulikowsky (Suse)", "Jaecki Schwarz (Manne)", "Boris Seidenberg (Boris)", "Gerhard Bienert ()", "Dieter Montag ()", "Leon Niemczyk ()", "Lev Durov ()", "Willi Schrade ()", "G\u00fcnter Wolf ()", "Manfred Zetzsche ()", "Erich Brauer ()", "Fred Delmare ()", "Irina Kiritschenko ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
