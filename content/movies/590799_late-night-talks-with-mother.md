While alive, Nemec's mother had a troubled relationship with her son; this rumination seems to be Nemec's public platform for coming to terms with unresolved familial issues. The director embellishes his film by linking personal events with 20th century history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y5ZCk7syqVwDsLQkeAEfO3P8xX6.jpg", "actors": ["Karel Roden ((voice))", "V\u00e1clav Havel (V\u00e1clav Havel)", "Jan N\u011bmec (Jan N\u011bmec)", "Zuzana Stiv\u00ednov\u00e1 (Mother)", "Marta Kubi\u0161ov\u00e1 (Marta Kubi\u0161ov\u00e1)", "Pavel Landovsk\u00fd (Pavel Landovsk\u00fd)", "V\u011bra Jirousov\u00e1 (V\u011bra Jirousov\u00e1)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Stiv\u00edn (Ji\u0159\u00ed Stiv\u00edn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
