When one of his classmates becomes frustrated with the math teacher's lack of sensitivity to the suicide, the student steals a rifle, returns to school, aerates the teacher's chest and then holds members of his class captive. This leads to an aggressive standoff with the police and lots of shots of his parents crying and bowing in shame, totally mortified.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xJ3pzXZghuw4KAo830iE59SbMEG.jpg", "actors": ["Shigeru Yamamoto (Jono Yasuhiro)", "Miyoko Akaza (Jono Hiroko)", "Yoshir\u00f4 Aoki (Kurita)", "Seiji End\u00f4 ()", "Eimei Esumi (Yoneshige)", "Yudai Ishiyama (Kojima)", "Shigeru Izumiya ()", "Ch\u00f4ichir\u00f4 Kawarasaki (Ogata)", "Akio Kuwasaki (Baba)", "Junko Miyashita (Murakami tomoyo)", "Akira Takahashi (Hirose)", "Minoru Uchida (Kobayashi)", "K\u00f4ichi Ueda (Yamauchi)", "Sakae Umezu (Jono Antaro)", "Atsuko Asano (Murakami)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
