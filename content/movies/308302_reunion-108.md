The only apparent commonality between the two groups is their success on the ball field, each team providing the locals with the only two minor league championships for the small town nestled in the valley of the Allegheny Mountains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rLA5CAEQigWbRmLdnyIy52CNS5D.jpg", "actors": ["Justin Grace (Casey Kelly)", "Jack Mulcahy (Teddy Mitchell)", "Kera O'Bryon (Ms. Higgins)", "James Claude Bristow (Todd Gordon)", "Billy Sample (Mombo)", "Jen Burry (Diva)", "Amaurys Rodriguez (Marky)", "Sara Oliva (Ginny)", "Matt Rochester (Widow)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
