The trial is given the full formal treatment it might receive in a civilian setting. The key point in this film is that these are the actual murderers admitting their actual crimes before a judges' panel consisting of their peers: actual prisoners at the same institution. Having no force of law, the trial proceeds without reaching a conclusion. That is something the viewer is asked to provide. This movie won a Silver Bear from the 1974 Berlin Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vPSrz4otROLuo66LBkfaj9lZEig.jpg", "actors": ["Gerd Siekmann (Richter)", "Heinz-Dietrich Stark (Anstaltsleiter)", "Hajo Wandschneider (Rechtsanwalt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
