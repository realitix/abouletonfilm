This critically acclaimed documentary takes us behind the masks of the militants called antifascists. In 2013 a group of armed nazis attacks a peaceful demonstration in Stockholm where several people are injured. In Greece the neo-nazi party Golden Dawn becomes the third largest in the election and in Malm\u00f6 the activist Showan Shattak and his friends are attacked by a group of nazis with knives and he ends up in a coma. In this portrait of the antifascists in Greece and Sweden we get to meet key figures that explain their view on their radical politics but also to question the level their own violence and militancy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lFe66b9arUdQ9KBjbDAlHb8fU8n.jpg", "actors": ["Kajsa Ekis Ekman ()", "Showan Shattak ()", "Athena Farrokhzad ()", "Joel Bjurstr\u00f6mer Almgren ()", "Spyros Marketos ()", "Lisa Bjurwald ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
