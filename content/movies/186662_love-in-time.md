Cho is a slacker who spends his day selling ice cream with his best friend/roommate Beer. Even though his ice cream truck business is failing, he still has a roof over his head because his apartment belongs to his uncle. When his cousin Tina decides to return to Hong Kong, Cho and Beer are forced to share their home with her, creating an antagonistic relationship between the three.
