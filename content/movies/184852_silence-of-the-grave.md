The film plays up its traditional mystery angle, with each of the guests being as likely a suspect as the next, in scenes such as one in which all of the guests sit around in the parlor and cast dramatic, accusatory glances at one another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rTreSWCSUJcczu2QoQDedFixp5Z.jpg", "actors": ["Alberto Dalb\u00e9s (Juan Ribas)", "Glenda Allen (Annette Lamark)", "Mario \u00c1lex (Vicente Durban)", "Montserrat Prous (Valerie Lamark)", "Luis Induni (Jerome Weber)", "Francisco Acosta (Jean-Paul)", "Kali Hansa (Laura)", "Yelena Samarina (Vera Steiner)", "Manuel Pereiro (Bongo)", "Caroline Rivi\u00e8re ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
