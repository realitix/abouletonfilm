{"tmdb_id": 371720, "title": "Clown", "original_title": "Clown", "slug_title": "clown", "date": "1968-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "A young French boy and his dog Clown romp happily through the streets, until one day the boy stops to play cards with friends in a park. After the game, Clown is seen running off. The little boy searches the streets for his beloved pet.  Along with Larry Yust's 'Lottery', 'Clown' was possibly one of the two best selling ed films ever made. On the surface, it's a cute kid &amp; dog story. Underlying is a possible subtext that fascinates us every time we view the film, and makes for a satisfying, yet ultimately ambiguous ending. Gilou Pelletier is outstanding as the small boy, and the camera work by Guy Suzuki takes wonderful advantage of the terraces of Montmartre.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gilou Pelletier (Young Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
