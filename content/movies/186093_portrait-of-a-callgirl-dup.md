She is romanced by materialism, and a type of lifestyle, but deep down something isn't right about the way she feels about herself. This manifests itself in her sexual emotions, and her dynamics, and this enables her to experience and come to terms with her deeper feelings of guilt and a lack of self worth. The story is intended to be a visually poetic and sexually powerful journey towards acquiring the freedom she has been searching for by being honest with herself, taking responsibility, and making amends.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jessie Andrews ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
