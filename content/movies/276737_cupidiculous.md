It conveys a humor story about Cupid, who makes Adam and Eve fall in love. But this act of love leads to overpopulation, overconsumption and global warming. So he has to find the way to fix these problems. Most characters and elements have been done in 3D but rendered as 2D flat vector look with poppy pastel, splashy and heightened color schemes. Then added more 2D liquid speed lines by drawing frame by frame. Even though laughter is the major objective, but Cupidiculous also delivers critical messages covertly. More or less audiences will get that with absolutely enjoyment.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
