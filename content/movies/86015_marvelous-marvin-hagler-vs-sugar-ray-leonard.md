The era was headlined by four all-time greats: Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns, and Roberto Duran. Between 1980 and 1985, each of them fought all the others, except for Hagler and Leonard. When they finally clashed in 1987, it was the climax of that extraordinary series \u2014 not literally the last fight among the foursome, but the last one that mattered. Hagler, the middleweight champion making his 13th defense, and Leonard, the former welterweight champ who was coming off a three-year retirement, were fighting for bragging rights over all their rivals. Who could have guessed that they would still be fighting over those bragging rights more than two decades later?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wZbtYhSQSov3jR5UL6gheCNW2wh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
