A special birthday party becomes a living nightmare for City-dwelling couple Sadie and Rick and their friend Johnny. They visit Corinne, an enigmatic local on the island of Amen, which is accessible only by invite and seemingly impossible to get off. A mysterious family connection with Corinne brings horrific consequences as they find themselves trapped by the tide and at the mercy of the island's wild nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ja8g30Gb3wv1NI3Q1dB21GOVQnM.jpg", "actors": ["Christina de Vallee (SADIE)", "Jonathan Keane (JONNY)", "David Paisley (RICK)", "Jill Riddiford (CORINNE)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
