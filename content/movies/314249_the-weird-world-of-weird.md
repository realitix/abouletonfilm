Then a TV special from the 70's called \"The Weird World of Weird\" where host Ralph Story takes us on a guide through the world of the occult. Next is \"Follow That Skirt\", a short film from 1964 that follows a gender confused man as he strangles and slashes the women he hates. The compilation wraps up with some recently uncovered footage of \"The Smut Peddler\", a lost nudie-cutie from '65 that involves a pervy publisher and a bevy of nude models.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zVGdT4JsSJ3UqR5IcASGLwyv7th.jpg", "actors": ["Ralph Story (Host (The Weird World Of Weird))", "Phil Leeds (Rosie the Dog (Rosie))", "Charles Taylor (Kip (Rosie))", "Anton LaVey (Himself (The Weird World Of Weird))", "Dale West (Dale (Follow That Skirt))", "W.B.
