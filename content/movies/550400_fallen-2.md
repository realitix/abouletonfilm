A decade has passed and the world is a colder, darker place. The duo still roam the city streets in search of any sinful pleasures that come their way, but they've become a shell of what they once were, no longer human or angel, trapped in an earthly purgatory, caught between the living and the dead. One fateful night they save a young woman's life. At first she seems like just another lost soul, but they soon realize she's much more. They learn Max (Leigh Raven) is pregnant and is carrying this generation's Savior. Both Heaven and Hell want the child for their own and have sent their most trusted servants to coerce Angel and Keith into handing over the anointed one. Arch Angels Gabriel (Misty Stone) and Azrael (Isiah Maxwell) offer Angel her wings back, as well as the return of her interstellar status.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c5mmGrEzkGqv5FGkTvG2PHjftZl.jpg", "actors": ["Jessica Drake (Angel)", "Leigh Raven (Max)", "Brad Armstrong (Keith)", "Tommy Pistol (Pharzuph)", "Misty Stone (Gabriel)", "Isiah Maxwell (Azrael)", "Luna Star (Sex Club Patron)", "August Taylor (Astaroth)", "Jenevieve Hexxx (Naamah)", "Codey Steele ()", "Derrick Pierce ()", "Eric Masterson ()", "John Strong ()", "Ryan Driller ()", "Seth Gamble ()", "Jenna Haze (Denise (nonsex))", "Tyler Nixon (Immanuel (nonsex))", "Nat Turnher (Kenny Kilroy (nonsex))", "Herschel Savage (Hal (nonsex))", "Chanel Preston (Satan's Double (nonsex))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
