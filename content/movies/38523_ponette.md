Little Ponette (Victoire Thivisol) is riding in a car with her mother when they're involved in a serious accident; Ponette survives, but her mother does not. Her father (Xavier Beauvois) initially reacts with anger over his late wife's careless driving, while her Aunt Claire (Claire Nebout) tries to comfort the child by telling her about Jesus and the resurrection. However, none of this does much to reassure Ponette or clarify her confusion about the practical realities and spiritual dilemma posed by death. In time, Ponette and her cousins Matiaz (Matiaz Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz) are sent off to boarding school, where they have to resolve their confusion and loss on their own. ~Mark Deming, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/32289bKHzGO4lyD8lUUIFYA5e5R.jpg", "actors": ["Delphine Schiltz (Delphine)", "Victoire Thivisol (Ponette)", "Matiaz Bureau Caton (Matiaz)", "L\u00e9opoldine Serre (Ada)", "Marie Trintignant (La m\u00e8re)", "Xavier Beauvois (Le p\u00e8re)", "Claire Nebout (La tante)", "Luckie Royer (Luce)", "Carla Ibled (Carla)", "Aur\u00e9lie V\u00e9rillon (Aur\u00e9lie)", "Henri Berthon (L'Instituteur)", "Antoine du Merle (Antoine)", "Marianne Favre (Marianne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [280571, 267948, 263112, 60531], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
