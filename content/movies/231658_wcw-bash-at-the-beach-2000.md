The main event was initially Jeff Jarrett versus Hulk Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, however a second world title match was held impromptu later in the evening. This has often been debated as to if it was a scripted event by Russo or not. Also on the card was Goldberg vs Kevin Nash, Buff Bagwell vs Shane Douglas, Vampiro vs The Demon in a Graveyard match, Scott Steiner defending the WCW United States Championship against Mike Awesome, Booker T vs Kanyon, The Perfect Event (Shawn Stasiak &amp; Chuck Palumbo) defending the WCW World Tag Team Titles against KroniK, Ms. Hancock vs Daffney in a Wedding Gown match, Big Vito vs Norman Smiley &amp; Ralphus for the WCW Hardcore Championship, and Lt. Loco defending the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Juventud Guerrera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ogC3YL1SZ0pexHcDFUUVLAo336x.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Jarrett (Himself)", "Hulk Hogan (Hollywood Hogan)", "Bill Goldberg (Goldberg)", "Kevin Nash (Himself)", "Marcus Alexander Bagwell (Buff Bagwell)", "Troy Martin (Shane Douglas)", "Ian Hodgkinson (Vampiro)", "Dale Torborg (The Demon)", "Booker Huffman (Booker T)", "Scott Carl Rechsteiner (Himself)", "Michael Alfonso (Mike Awesome)", "Christopher Morgan Klucsarits (Kanyon)", "Shawn Stipich (Shawn Stasiak)", "Chuck Palumbo (Himself)", "Brian Adams (Himself)", "Bryan Clark (Himself)", "Stacy Keibler (Ms. Hancock)", "Shannon Claire Spruill (Daffney)", "Norman Smiley (Himself)", "John Riker (Ralphus)", "Vito Joseph LoGrasso (Big Vito)", "Chavo Guerrero (Lt.
