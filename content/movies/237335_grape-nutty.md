What a coincidence... at that moment, there is only one grape left. Both try to pretend they don't want it but each secretly tries to make off with the last grape first. They try using a fishing rod only to hook each other. The crow sneaks across in a pair of underwear but is discovered by the fox. The crow tries sleepwalking but is again discovered. After feuding with each other through the phone, they attack each other and a free-for-all ensues. Finally, the crow decides this sparring isn't worth it and insists the fox can have the last grape. The fox, now equally courteous, offers it to the crow who doesn't want it. At this point, the feuding begins anew.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
