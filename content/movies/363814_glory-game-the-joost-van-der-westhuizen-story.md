The disease attacks the central nervous system, causing progressive disability. There is no known cure. THE PROGNOSIS IS DEATH.Anyone who\u2019s seen Joost in action will know that he\u2019s not one to give up without a fight. His game-changing prowess as a rugby player is now galvanised in a battle for survival and, more importantly, to make a difference to the lives of others with the disease.Despite specialist assurances that he\u2019d be in a wheelchair in a year and not likely see his 42th birthday, Joost not only celebrated in style, but took to the skies, travelling internationally with his J9 Foundation to meet the great minds who are working to find a cure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9c6Yk0neJuuBLAretPRH6TlRYSh.jpg", "actors": ["Franco Booysens ()", "Liam Schwegler ()", "Christian Schwegler ()", "Riley Schwegler ()", "Jarod Smith ()", "Donovon Lottering ()", "Richard Pinkey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
