Before he could announce his joy openly, his enemies, Zoravar and Shamsher, take over the castle, killing him instantly. His loyal employees, Prithvi and Dilawar, escape with the children - one son ends up with a blood disorder that discolors his skin and leaves his left arm paralyzed, and is left with a dacoit. The other son is brought up by Army Chief Prithvi Singh, while the empress herself is held captive. Years later, the sons have grown up, the one with the dacoits is called kaali Singh, while the other is called Karan.
