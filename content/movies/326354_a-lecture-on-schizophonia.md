The invention of the telephone and the phonograph at end of the nineteenth century marks a rupture in our experience of the human voice - a rupture which simultaneously fulfills a promise given by prophets and shamen since ancient times. Suddenly a voice can issue from out of nowhere, from the wrong mouth or from beyond the grave. Listening to our own voice, we experience ourselves as others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7E8T9t37hlYUl577jaUUMZvUPhz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
