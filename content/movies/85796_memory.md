While elucidating the mystery and fuzziness as well as merits and demerits of memory in idealizing reality, the story develops into a tale of destruction of human beings, turning the existence of the earth into a memory of the universe. The production, only 5 minutes long, greatly helps expand the viewer's imagination, embodying the enchantment of animation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/637TJzLNTlafWLcgkevuI6A1L6E.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
