At home, when his mother, the boss of a construction gang, bids for and gets the job of building the Town Hall, other gangs set out to disrupt her business and try to kill her.  Word of this is brought to Ryuji, who returns to help, and finds the gangs against him.  The rival gang bosses give his mother an ultimatum to appear at a meeting to settle their differences, but Ryuji goes in her place.  His mother hurries after him, but is shot by one of the hired killers. Ryuji faces the bosses alone, and would have lost the fight had not his friend, an army captain, on maneuvers with his men, come to his rescue. Ryuji hurries to the hospital and takes the bullet from his mother's body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j1Tc2kXDHjsbucc77jkQjNVe5NO.jpg", "actors": ["Masako Izumi ()", "Toshio Sugiyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
