The town\u2019s close-knit community prepares to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Bisbee\u2019s darkest hour: the infamous Bisbee Deportation of 1917, during which 1,200 striking miners were violently taken from their homes, banished to the middle of the desert, and left to die. Townspeople confront this violent, misunderstood past by staging dramatic recreations of the escalating strike. These dramatized scenes are based on subjective versions of the story and \u201cdirected,\u201d in a sense, by residents with conflicting views of the event. Deeply personal segments torn from family history build toward a massive restaging of the deportation itself on the exact day of its 100th anniversary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u2mtK0C7dIlzigxyNZGxw3z3AKF.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Serrano ()", "Laurie Mckenna ()", "Ray Family ()", "Graeme Family ()", "Mike Anderson ()", "Richard Hodges ()", "James West ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "etwjMcdvxx8"}
