Having enjoyed a conventionally successful early career, Klimt's art changed radically in his mid-thirties. He became leader of the Vienna Secession, a group of avant-garde artists who would change the conservative Viennese art scene forever. Klimt\u00b9s own work became increasingly erotic in nature. His deeply sensual portraits of Viennese women still make a powerful impression upon the modern viewer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rDjkG6slsqnb3arqJytiOcJYJTA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
