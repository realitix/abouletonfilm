This candid view casts an intimate and personal light on Israel's youth. We explore what they see, how they think, what they learn, and the astonishing impact their thoughts and lives have on their country and the world they are rapidly inheriting. It's their opinions that matter, as they are the ones who are creating our future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l8DBCMepcErm3vFgCC1xaQkg2TX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
