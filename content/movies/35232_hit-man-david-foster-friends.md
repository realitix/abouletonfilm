Not only are the songs magical, the performances are just as enchanting, including appearances from Andrea Bocelli, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Josh Groban, Kenny G, Katharine McPhee, Celine Dion, Blake Shelton, Brian McKnight, and Charice. Spotlighting #1 hits, award-winning songs, and other favorites -- all but one originally penned and/or produced by Foster -- this May 23, 2008 show at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas was unforgettable.
