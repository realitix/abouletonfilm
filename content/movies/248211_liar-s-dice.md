Whilst it did not have the \"happily ever after\" ending which might have made it more of a cliche', neither did it end with enough of enough explanation to give a good sense of closure. Instead we're left hanging with so many unanswered questions as to make the \"gee did I really spend all this time watching for THIS ambiguous ending?\" feeling to be the most dominant. It could have done more and would have gotten a higher rating from me had it done so. Good for what it is, and what it's trying to tell, but meh in the end. Sad."}], "recommandations_id": [390606, 485608, 339143, 488446]}
