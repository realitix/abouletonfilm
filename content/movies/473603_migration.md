The migration of the title is interpreted as the flight of a ghost bird through aeons of space/time, through the micro-macro universe, through a myriad of complex realities. A seagull is seen flying gracefully in slow motion against a grainy green sky; suddenly the frame stops, warps and burns, as though caught in the gate of the projector. Now begins an alternation of fast and slow sequences in which the bird flies through time-lapse clouds and fog and, in a stroboscopic crescendo, hurtles into the sun's corona. Successive movements of the film develop rhythmic, organic counterpoints in which cosmic transformations send jelly fish into the sky and ocean waves into the sun. It concludes with stop-frame slow-motion of the bird, transformed once again into flesh.\" - Gene Youngblood", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5aBF81vhOukmQSQTcrnT1RkuhUP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
