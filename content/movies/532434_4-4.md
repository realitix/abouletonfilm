Wonderfully constructed with rhythmic visuals and sound design, \u201c4/4\u201d, directed by Kyle Sawyer, is about the battle between creator and creativity. Sarah sits down to the keyboard. She starts her metronome and hopes for inspiration. It doesn\u2019t come. But the metronome continues to sway back and forth, back and forth, merging seamlessly into life. Sawyer executes with great attention to detail, finding a taunting beat in mundane actions, preparing coffee, brushing teeth, and building an atmosphere of frustration. There\u2019s an epic quality to this battle of the will, but it\u2019s also imbued with a sense of humor \u2014 it may not seem like a big deal, but it feels like one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rHjaDCgc5HsCocCP86xLxql6uWO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
