This dramatic comedy is a cross between Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and \"Northern Exposure\" (1990). Set in the real town of Jake's Corner, Arizona, it is a rest stop for travelers making their way through the Arizona desert, but for the people who live there, it's a rest stop for life. Johnny and the eclectic ensemble that live and work in the town occupy trailers behind the Corner Store and Jake's Corner Bar. Through the years, this cast of misfits has become closer than most families - they are kin. The dynamic of the town is changed forever when Johnny's young nephew comes to live with him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eQtg2hyF8ccEBkDTgfMLTb2s2ux.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Trejo ()", "Richard Tyson ()", "Diane Ladd ()", "Colton Rodgers ()", "Tony Longo ()", "B.J.
