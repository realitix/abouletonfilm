The film opens with footage of the deserted site of Fukushima in 2011, the camera functioning as a drone scaling the wreckage. This is followed by scenes of the monkey alone in her habitat, silhouetted against the empty, dark restaurant. In this dystopian setting, an animal acts out the human condition, trapped, endlessly repeating her unconscious role.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/krLDZBJF4B2ctXcPy5HZmJ1MkbQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
