An increasing obsession with mysterious fetish objects ultimately results in a tear in the fabric of reality that threatens to turn their respective worlds inside out. A hallucinatory fever dream in which nothing is what it at first appears to be, Sanctum and Sacrum opens a portal between the ancient world of myth and symbol and the banal pastels of a Florida apartment. It is a matrix of transformation, in which the lives of two couples intersect via a web spun from trance-like rituals of desire and the ever present origin of myth.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
