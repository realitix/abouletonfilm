This gesture led to the deconstruction of a language whereupon grammatical, syntactic and semantic structures were used to determine certain patterns of an artistic statement. Her poems were shaped by coincidence, which made their language more open and process-orientated. The confrontation with the elements associated with femininity (water, wind) made it possible to face the patriarchal patterns rooted in the language.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pGtmJYKojbWQAFZt5wTW2ydowNP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
