She was once a successful surgeon; her husband Arthur (Sanjiban), a brilliant scientist. But now, they exist in a world of emptiness and solitude, continuing the radical artificial intelligence research that Arthur had started a lifetime before. Before the accident. Now, after four years of ceaseless work, they've made a breakthrough, a discovery so great that it could change the face of science. But it will also require a sacrifice so great, that Magdalena's world will never be the same.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d2Q04iulF0KltOhXRTJIyKtfFHk.jpg", "actors": ["David Anselmo (Andrew)", "Sanjiban Sellew (Arthur)", "Amy Shelton-White (Magdalena)", "Robert Weingartner (Jim)", "Konrad Rogowski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [27669, 83101, 37001, 13371], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
