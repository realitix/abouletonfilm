Hailed internationally as a master of the short story, MacLeod also wrote a novel, No Great Mischief, which was celebrated around the world. Depicting men and women living out their lives against the haunting landscape that surrounds them, most of MacLeod's work is firmly based in Cape Breton even if his characters stray elsewhere. Focusing on the complexities and abiding mysteries at the heart of human relationships, MacLeod maps the close bonds and impassable chasms that lie between people and invokes memory and myth to celebrate the continuity of the generations. This film portrait explores the life and work of this giant of literature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uGWP6dqY90jLMF5tKPECVElh5LB.jpg", "actors": ["Alistair MacLeod (Himself)", "Margaret Atwood (Herself)", "Russell Banks (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
