While her son gambles about the playground, Riko and Sachiko exchange child-rearing war stories and soon become friends. Then she learns that the prime suspect of her case is none other than Sachiko's husband. Moreover, she learns that Sachiko's son was in fact the center of a kidnapping case several years ago and the child has been long thought of as dead. Her husband and the detective in charge of child's case both have their own secrets, and soon Riko finds herself and her son threatened.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ryoko Takizawa (Riko)", "Toru Kazama ()", "Mieko Harada ()", "Koichi Hashizume ()", "Toshiya Nagasawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
