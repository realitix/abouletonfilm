A liveliness of half-alive bodies , both human and animal, that catch fire in a latent bullfight and which, in becoming pers\u014dnae, inhabit sarcophagi which crumble into solid ground like streams of water that suddenly submerge clouds, swinging on the brink of a vertiginous fall of nocturnal glances in the middle of exotic poses and aerial visions.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
