But when the boyfriend of the team's lead girl falls for her, she'll have to fight to win her place amongst these venomous girls. Breaking Legs is sure one to kick your boots off and pull up your heels, as these kids dance the field away to compete for the homecoming crown at R. Murray High School. Will it be newbie Bloom, or her arch nemesis and Dance Team leader, Harmony? Watch as the two square off in this fun but odd match to the finish. Someone is doomed to 'Break a Leg' on the dance floor, or rather, the football field!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fkZSSDTTLqYlDDNDRQeGkaqPtkk.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Meriwether (GG)", "Chris Kattan (Robby)", "Richard Riehle (Principal Bater)", "Lizz Carter (Lala Swoon)", "Timothy Brennen (Mr. Schuster)", "Alexa Sutherland (Harmony Swoon)", "Liv Southard (Bloom)", "Lauren Harper (Dancer)", "Mary Rachel Gardner (Dancer)", "Fidelia Grace (Dancer)", "Darby Steeves (Dancer)", "Aaron R Landon (Jake)", "William Leon (Herbie Schuster)", "Sarah Rochelle Gluzman (Gracie)", "Maria Pallas (Miss Tarble)", "Kayley Stallings (Cinda)", "Aubrey Manning (Sister Mary Gaberdine)", "Mark Marchillo (Mayn)", "Kristin Morris (Dancer)", "Vincent van Hinte (Doug Swoon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tX_VvD8qx9g"}
