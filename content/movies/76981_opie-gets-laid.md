One day a drug dealer named Thai (April Wade) mistakenly comes to his door. She decides to help Opie by finding him a good woman, initially (and unsuccessfully) by online personal adds. Thai and Opie end up sleeping together while high on marijuana, and then end up seeing each other regularly. Opie starts having sex with other women, including Thai's lesbian lover Dakota (Ute Werner) and a \"gun-toting\" nymphomaniac named Rain (Jesselynn Desmond).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8TvKxy8IhIHSV594W78X02jisnZ.jpg", "actors": ["James Ricardo (Opie)", "April Wade (Thai)", "Ute Werner (Dakota)", "Jesselynn Desmond (Rain)", "Gina DeVettori (Alicia)", "Samantha Turk (Randi)", "Heidemarie Fuentes (Jackie)", "Mark Wood (Travis)", "Hutchi Hancock (Kimmy)", "Ellen Hughes (Mom)", "Peder Fedde (Dad)", "Michael Connelly (Mike)", "Laith Arasaf (First Guy)", "Chris Mitchell (Second Guy)", "Rob Lanza (Third Guy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
