Aboard the train are a pair of pickpockets, a honeymoon couple, a drunk, a temperance pamphleteer and a host of familiar types, all more-or-less bizarre in characteristically English ways. Bob takes an unexpected course of action, and the characters start interacting in varied and unexpected ways. When, at last, the train stops, all has been resolved, but not as might have been expected at the beginning of the journey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7krChiBDx3GfmWRKWUd9SWo90Du.jpg", "actors": ["Godfrey Tearle (Sir Wilfred Rhodes)", "Hugh Williams (Gerald Winter)", "Judy Gunn (Diana Gregory)", "Mickey Brantford (Tom)", "Julien Mitchell (Bob Holt)", "Olga Lindo (Mrs. Holt)", "Michael Hogan (Charlie)", "Frank Pettingell (Goddard)", "Eliot Makeham (Pip)", "Eve Gray (Daisy)", "Sydney Fairbrother (Mrs. Grebe)", "Sam Wilkinson (The Stutterer)", "Viola Compton (Miss Smith)", "John Lloyd (The Steward)", "Nelson Keys (The Frenchman)", "Aubrey Mallalieu (Mulchester Doctor)", "Cyril Smith (Postal Sorter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
