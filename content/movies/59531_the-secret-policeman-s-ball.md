Peter Luff left Amnesty in 1978 and the organisation's new fund-raising officer, Peter Walker, was deputed to work with Lewis on reconfiguring the show to raise more money and greater awareness of Amnesty. Lewis proposed to Cleese that in addition to the comedy performances the show should feature some contemporary rock musicians. Cleese delegated this responsibility to Lewis who recruited Who guitarist Pete Townshend to perform, as well as New Wave singer-songwriter Tom Robinson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cu2jkCi5H3eJu5zyiI6mKPT3aHC.jpg", "actors": ["Rowan Atkinson (Various Roles)", "John Cleese (Himself - Various Roles)", "Billy Connolly (Himself)", "Peter Cook (Various Roles)", "Michael Palin (Various Roles)", "Pete Townshend (Himself)", "Terry Jones (Himself - Various Roles)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
