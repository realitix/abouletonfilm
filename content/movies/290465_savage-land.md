Two women and two kids are stranded in the Old West when bad guys (posing as Indians) try to snag the stagecoach's cargo. Pitted against nature, time, and the pursuing baddies, this unlikely team must trek over the mountains to reach safety. This is a video to buy and keep in your collection... great mid-winter rental when cabin-fever makes you long for the great outdoors!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mTtN7CfVRpXkOW6BmFh8uuWHC0V.jpg", "actors": ["Corbin Bernsen (Quint)", "Vivian Schilling (Clara)", "Brion James (Cyrus)", "Mercedes McNab (Hanna Morgan)", "Graham Greene (Skyano)", "Charles Napier (Cole)", "Bo Svenson (Jeb)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zG6jETB-u7I"}
