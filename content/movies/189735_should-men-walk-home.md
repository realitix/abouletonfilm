And she quickly hooks up with a male partner in crime, in this case a Gentleman Crook played by perpetually grinning Creighton Hale. Mabel seems a little livelier in this film than in some of her other late works. In the very first scene we find her hitch-hiking, and she's forced to make a mad dash for cover when Hale's car nearly hits her. Soon they team up and crash a swanky party in a mansion to steal a jewel from the host's safe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p5fH61sX6HgwCRP28RRSEUyPbMM.jpg", "actors": ["Mabel Normand (The Girl Bandit)", "Creighton Hale (The Gentleman Crook)", "Eugene Pallette (Detective, Intelligence Bureau)", "Oliver Hardy (Party Guest at Punch Bowl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
