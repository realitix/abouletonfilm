Although Yoshida and his generation outspokenly rejected the values of Ozu, Kurosawa and the older humanist filmmakers, over the years Yoshida found himself increasingly drawn back to Ozu\u2019s films, fascinated by their unique rigor, formal language and delicate balance between comedy and tragedy. For Japanese television, Yoshida adapted his own text into a four part documentary, which he also condensed into the one hour version.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3X6dbE3q3eTSJgiGcMIIFJbJwyC.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshishige Yoshida (Himself)", "Yasujir\u014d Ozu (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
