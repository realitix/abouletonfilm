The town of Middle Spring is more than happy to welcome them with open arms, however; located in the rhinestone buckle of the Bible Belt, Middle Spring is smack-dab in the middle of a big barbecue and tent revival and there\u2019s always room at their table for a few more warm bodies.  Unfortunately, no one in Middle Spring is exactly who they seem to be\u2014 this town takes the Bible quite literally, and the friends have to stick together as time begins to run out and they realize that what\u2019s on the menu may be closer to home than they suspected.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zdUh5IT1NFsUtzJMKwcbbc20vks.jpg", "actors": ["Marilyn Burns (Beulah Standifer)", "Avery Pfeiffer (Blake Mills)", "Dakota Buchanan (Young Brahm)", "Carl Bailey (The Hunter)", "Cody Daniel (Congregation)", "Stan-Lee Ray Baker (Congregation)", "Sheril Rodgers (Janet Ranscombe)", "Samantha Powell (Congregation)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [149232, 435035, 260435, 91352], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
