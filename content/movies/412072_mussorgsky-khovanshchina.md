It is a work of immense power and humanity, set at the time when Peter the Great assumed power in Russia, a turning point in Russia's history when old forces came into conflict with new. Political intrigue, religious persecution, the tragedy of a nation, all form a backdrop against which individual dramas are acted out. The great Bulgarian bass, Nicolai Ghiaurov sings Prince Ivan Khovansky, the leader of the revolutionary Streltsys and Paata Burchuladze sings Dositheus, the leader of the Old Believers. Fellow Russians, including Ludmila Semtschuk as Marfa and Vladimir Atlantov as Khovansky's son, complete this formidable cast. This live recording of Alfred Kirchner's production of Khovanshchina is conducted by Claudio Abbado.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6OXZ0eFuIiS2vXiIvEagVVRNBSM.jpg", "actors": ["Nicolai Ghiaurov (Ivan Khovansky)", "Vladimir Atlantov (Andrey Khovansky)", "Yuri Marusin (Vasily Golitsyn)", "Anatoly Kocherga (Shaklovity)", "Paata Burchuladze (Dosifey)", "Ludmila Semtschuk (Marfa)", "Brigitte Poschner-Klebel (Susanna)", "Heinz Zednik (Scribe)", "Joanna Borowska (Emma)", "Wilfried Gahmlich (Kuzka)", "Timothy Breese (Streshniev)", "Claudio Abbado (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
