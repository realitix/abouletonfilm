Part snapshot of the zeitgeist part cycling agit-prop this is one of the best developed examples of Irish alternative television production. Despite being fast paced and entertaining One Less Car doesn\u2019t shy away from complex topics and, sometimes ambiguous or contradictory viewpoints.

If anything convinces you that cycling is todays most relevant transport issue, it\u2019ll be One Less Car.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
