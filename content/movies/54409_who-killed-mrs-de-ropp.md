On a train journey, Saki meets Mrs De Ropp, oppressive aunt and guardian to an unruly brood. Inspired by the meeting, he imagines a tale of repressed children who find solace in their childish wonder, and are saved by their imagination. This innovative drama mixes live action and animation and is both a dark social satire of Edwardian attitudes to children and a fairytale for grown-ups.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3QdQcSriK96zu9dkiMi6dD2RTUL.jpg", "actors": ["Gemma Jones (Mrs. De Ropp)", "Ben Daniels (Saki)", "Thomas Byrne (Cyril)", "Bill Milner (Nicholas)", "Samuel Honywood (Conradin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
