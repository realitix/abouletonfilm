The film is hosted/presented by Richard Burton, Thomas's friend, who narrates the story and appears from time to time amidst the Welsh landscape. Burton had already appeared in Douglas Cleverdon's acclaimed BBC radio dramatization of Thomas's 'play for voices' Under Milk Wood in the 1950s and, in the early Seventies, would appear in director Andrew Sinclair's film version as First Voice.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Richard Burton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
