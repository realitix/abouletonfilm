This is followed by Comfort interviewing people about Adolf Hitler; their responses indicate a lack of historical knowledge, although he also finds a neo-Nazi who claims to love Hitler. Comfort proposes a hypothetical situation to his interviewees, asking if they would kill Hitler if they had the opportunity at that time in history. He asks more hypotheticals dealing with what his interviewees might do in other circumstances related to the Holocaust. He then switches his topic to make similar comparisons to abortion within the United States and the right to life, personalizing his arguments to make comparisons between the Holocaust and abortion in order to place the interviewees on the spot. The documentary concludes with Comfort stating that over 50 million abortions have occurred to date; he calls this the \"American Holocaust\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lNRJ817AW4365j9antTPEKsUdoO.jpg", "actors": ["Ray Comfort (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7y2KsU_dhwI"}
