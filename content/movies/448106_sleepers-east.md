Covering a bachelor party for a friend in need, Lena winds up at a gambling house where she is the sole witness when Mayor Wentworth's drunken lout of a son shoots the owner.  Wentworth's political machine wants Lena to falsely incriminate mob boss Callahan to bolster their re-election campaign.  Callahan's mouthpiece nabs Lena first, conveying her stealthily by train from Toledo to New York to prevent her from testifying against the big boss. A midnight special smash-up, a tense courtroom finale and true love triumphant round out this typical Fox pre-Code programmer, released just before the Legion of Decency dropped the hammer in 1934.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6V5zqhBywzpMX5pV3FyNcUvxwrC.jpg", "actors": ["Wynne Gibson (Lena Karelson)", "Preston Foster (Jason Everett)", "Mona Barrie (Ada Robillard)", "Harvey Stephens (Martin Knox)", "Roger Imhof (MacGowan)", "J.
