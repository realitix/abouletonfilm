Her husband, Victor, has been gone for three weeks, and Maria is really feeling his loss (\"I thought I didn't need friends with Victor around, and now that he's gone, my friends have decided the same thing.\"). Maria is neglecting her work--she is the inventor of an experimental female fertility drug, and her colleague, Vladimir, is picking up the slack.
