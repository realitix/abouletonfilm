Incomes are not. PUSH sheds light on a new kind of faceless landlord, our increasingly unliveable cities and an escalating crisis that has an effect on us all. This is not gentrification, it\u2019s a different kind of monster.The film follows Leilani Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, as she\u2019s travelling the globe, trying to understand who\u2019s being pushed out of the city and why. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a huge difference between housing as a commodity and gold as a commodity. Gold is not a human right, housing is,\u201d says Leilani.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b7a9j6iXrurQTJkU8u9NL1CSj8X.jpg", "actors": ["Leilani Farha (herself)", "Saskia Sassen (herself)", "Joseph Stiglitz (himself)", "Roberto Saviano (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Eh7-7e4QgPk"}
