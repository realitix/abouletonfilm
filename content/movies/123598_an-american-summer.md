He is unhappy with the new arrangement and finds his new bohemian lifestyle strange and the activities of his new peers, stupid. His life begins to change a bit when he befriends a young surfer named Fin. At first he thinks of the fun-loving Fin as a real dolt, but later he admits he was wrong. Like the Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn characters on which they are loosely based, the two new friends soon find themselves having a series of adventures, some of them dangerous; by the summer's end, Tom finds himself wiser, accustomed to California, and a lot more grown up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3CcrIb8Uf4dnvsapNjyxtqD79pi.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Austin Green (Charles 'Fin' Findley)", "Michael Landes (Tom Travis)", "Brian Krause (Joey)", "Wayne P\u00e9re (Rockman)", "Barrett Sherwood (Surfer / Beach Bum)", "Chance Boyer (Forgot)", "Tony Crane (Bo)", "Sherri\u00e9 Austin (Cari)", "Amber Susa (Traci)", "Karen Teliha (Bag Lady)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "k8lvuh9m-l0"}
