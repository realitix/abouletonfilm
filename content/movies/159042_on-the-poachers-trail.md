Vasek is expected to go to Bulgaria for a holiday with his parents during the summer vacation, but the boy finds the prospect of spending the summer with his gamekeeper grandfather far more tempting than the seaside. On the last day of school Vasek picks up his final report, but after that he takes his already packed bag and sets off for the Bohemian Forest without telling his parents. The grandfather is happy to have his grandson at his side again. In the evening, he gets a phone call from Vasek's mother. The trip to Bulgaria has been postponed and Vasek can stay with his grandfather for the time being.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j74NNh46pGTlkeGoM84ArRs8jYJ.jpg", "actors": ["Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hol\u00fd (Va\u0161ek)", "Gust\u00e1v Valach (Hajn\u00fd Straka)", "Jana Brejchov\u00e1 (Jarmila Strakov\u00e1, Vaskova maminka)", "Josef Kemr (Pernikar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
