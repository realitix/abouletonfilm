One young man, our hero, led the battle against the TV ban. He searched the country for the biggest rock groups to perform at a concert in support of his cause. But the enemies of rock 'n' roll had other plans...  The zany, madcap Never Too Young To Rock was made at the high point of glam rock in 1975. It offers a unique opportunity to experience the driving, feelgood sounds of the era\u2019s top pop combos in their pomp. From the infectious choruses of Mud\u2019s \u2018Tiger Feet\u2019 and \u2018The Cat Crept In\u2019, through the catchy doo-wop of The Rubettes, to percussive anthems like The Glitter Band\u2019s \u2018Angel Face\u2019, this film provides aural nostalgia at its most intense.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1LdvDF2GbfV2PkyhtUxuFfhFRco.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Denyer (Hero)", "Freddie Jones (Mr. Rockbottom)", "Sheila Steafel (Cafe Proprietress)", "Joe Lynch (Russian Soldier)", "John Clive (Bandsman)", "Peter Noone (Army Captain)", "Sally James (Herself)", "Peter Powell (Himself)", "Midge Ure (Himself (uncredited, as Midge Ure and Slik))", "The Rubettes (Themselves)", "Mud (Themselves)", "Glitter Band (Themselves)", "Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band (Themselves)", "Scott Fitzgerald (Himself)", "Joe Dunne ()", "Robert Longden ()", "Nosher Powell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KLMb_IEFnBs"}
