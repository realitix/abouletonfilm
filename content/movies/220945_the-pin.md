Time melts as he relives their days and nights spent hiding in a barn in Lithuania, fighting for survival as World War Two rages around them. Brought together in these extreme circumstances, what starts as mistrust develops into love, marriage and ultimately murder. In the end, the Shomer is able to find peace after a lifetime of regret by fulfilling a promise he made to the young Leah on their last night together. ~ Naomi Jaye. THE PIN is the first Yiddish film to be made in Canada, and was partly inspired by the writer/director\u2019s late grandmother, Leah, whose personal phobia formed the core of this moving story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aP1Z0F2xK01OirrnREUXe9i3ttp.jpg", "actors": ["Milda Gecaite (Leah)", "Grisha Pasternak (Jacob)", "Paskal Vaklev (Danya)", "David Fox (Shomer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
