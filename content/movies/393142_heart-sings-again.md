This is the story of a popular singer-actress (Aunor) who went into seclusion after the traumatic experience of watching her pregnant sister die in the wake of a stampede of her fans. Nearly twenty years later she took in a young girl who wanted to be a star and tried to mold her into a copy of what she was before.
