The story unravels quite well with good dialog and superior acting from the entire cast. The movie is philosophical without being bogged down by the some times heavy content. A very refreshing look at life, getting old, being free and always finding ways to share, appreciate and enjoy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sKFmZJYX1qLcMxfHRyY3Na5wBoC.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Diego ()", "S\u00edlvia Munt ()", "Eusebio Poncela ()", "Mercedes Mor\u00e1n ()", "Mario Paolucci ()", "Gustavo Salmer\u00f3n ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
