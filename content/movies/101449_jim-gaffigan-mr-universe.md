This 75-minute special contains more of Gaffigan's trademark, surreal humor on food, life, his nit-picky fans, and whales in denial.  Also, a part of the proceeds from sales of Mr. Universe will go to the Bob Woodruff Foundation, a organization which assists veterans and their families as servicemen return to civilian life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hEwxqaWY7fptXNOeXi8U6LRwA2k.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Gaffigan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [20837, 263111, 108930, 16453], "youtube_key": "gsMqakE7noE"}
