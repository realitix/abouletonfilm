The three 90-foot rolls he created were edited together to complete the journey from Manhattan to Brooklyn, entitled Across the Brooklyn Bridge. Because the film was shot on the short-lived 68mm gauge format stock, it was not viewed by modern audiences until 2004, when the British Film Institute restored it to 35mm.  As a commission by the Museum of Modern Art for the re-opening of their facility in a new design by architect Yoshio Taniguch, American avant-garde filmmaker Bill Morrison took this remarkable footage and recombined it with itself to form a new split-screen extrapolation. Violinist and composer Todd Reynolds created the film\u2019s original soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oBQNkmfpSgxDezXtNMmcu7XtCRs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
