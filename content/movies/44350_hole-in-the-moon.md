Although conceived in the style of Mekas\u2019 \u201cHallelujah the hills\u201d (1962), it\u2019s an authentically Israeli satire, an openly rebellious and individualistic expression that poked fun at the sacred myths of earlier zionist films. The technique of film within the film is used to portray cinema as reflection of the imagination, a miracle based on dreams and fantasies that take on concrete characteristics \u2013 parallel to the miracle of Israel, the dream that has become reality. Although not a commercial success, its importance is beyond any measure, though it remains a unique experiment, boldly uncommercial and subversive, out of any context in that patriotic, ideological epoch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wV6NLo6i7xWIKkMpSVkz9evupfd.jpg", "actors": ["Arik Leibovitch ()", "Shmulik Kraus ()", "Israel Gurion ()", "Uri Zohar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
