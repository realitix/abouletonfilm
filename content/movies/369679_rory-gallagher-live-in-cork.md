Such was the occasion that Irish Television (RTE) had its cameras there to capture the homecoming.  This DVD contains the concert originally released on VHS as \"Messin' With The Kid - Live At The Cork Opera House\", but now with superior audio. To compliment this landmark performance, a unique and highly personal \"Rough Guide To Rory's Cork\" has been compiled, showing locations, memorabilia and rare &amp; unseen photographs - all supplemented with anecdotes. Plus, there's the \"Big Guns\" short documentary, a comprehensive discography and much more.  TRACK LISTING  1. Continental Op 2. Tattoo'd Lady 3. Don't Start Me Talkin' 4. I Ain't No Saint 5.
