But soon filmmakers also began focusing their attention on hands. Using film extracts, Farocki explores this visual language, its symbolism, Freudian slips, automatisms and its music.

They can also function as a conduit (exchanging money) or witness to a form of competence (work).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1UnHnCNpf6CcUcSiaRpN6V4gEZk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [128941, 158292, 145013, 125713], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
