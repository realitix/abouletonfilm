Frantic, scared and on the verge of death, this little girl captures the heart of S\u00fcleyman, who risks his own life to save her, smuggling her into his Army base and out of harms way. Not knowing her name and unable to communicate with her, S\u00fcleyman names her Ayla, in reminiscence of the moon on the fateful night during which they met. The two form an instantaneous and inseparable bond, and Ayla, almost effortlessly, brings an uncanny joy to the Turkish brigade in the grip of war. As the war comes to a close however, S\u00fcleyman's brigade is told that they will be returning home. S\u00fcleyman cannot bear abandoning Ayla, and does everything within his power to take her with him. After repeated failure, he is forced to give Ayla to an orphanage, but doesn't give up on the hope of one day reuniting with her. Will the two ever get back together?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ggtQgembIFKJcSSeuxJocOklasp.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c7etin Tekindor (Sergeant S\u00fcleyman)", "\u0130smail Hac\u0131o\u011flu (Young Sergeant S\u00fcleyman)", "Lee Kyung-jin (Ayla (Kim Eunja))", "Kim Seol (Young Ayla)", "Ali Atay (Ali)", "Murat Yildirim (Lieutenant Mesut)", "Taner Birsel (Major Fuat)", "Mehmet Esen (Colonel Celal)", "Eric Roberts (Major General Coulter)", "Erkan Petekkaya (Iskenderun Major)", "Kim Byoungsoon (South Korean General)", "Altan Erkekli (Huseyin Dilbirligi)", "Cade Carradine (Captain Lorenzo Cage)", "Meral \u00c7etinkaya (Nimet Dilbirligi)", "G\u00f6zde Sinem \u00d6zt\u00fcrk (Journalist \u00d6zge (as Sinem Uslu))", "Ali Bark\u0131n (Pepe Muharrem)", "Caner Kurtaran (Sadik)", "Bur\u00e7 K\u00fcmbetlio\u011flu (Celal)", "\u0130lber G\u00fcrtunca (\u0130lhan)", "Johnny Young (Lieutenant Lee)", "Kang Yeon Jeong (Ji-Min)", "Damla S\u00f6nmez (Nuran)", "Halil Kumova (Nuran's uncle)", "Nilg\u00fcn Kasapbasoglu (Ummu Gulsum Dilbirligi)", "B\u00fc\u015fra Develi (Young Nimet Dilbirligi)", "Koray Ergun (Halit)", "Mine Teber (Nevsal)", "Esra Dermanc\u0131o\u011flu (Sebahat Dilbirligi)", "Claudia Memory Monroe (Marilyn Monroe)", "Toygan Avano\u011flu (Pusan Army Officer)", "Chaby Han (Sung Joon)", "Ko Eun-min (Ayla's Mother)", "Cho Wan-ki (Ayla's Father)", "Duygu Yeti\u015f (\u0130clal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [450720, 246871, 477313, 449546], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
