The performance, a parachute jump, is carried out by an artist (Perrenet) and his girlfriend during the opening of an exhibition. As spectators to the performance, which takes place in the artist\u2019s studio, an art dealer and several friends have been invited. The art dealer enters first, followed by Armand, who looks at some paintings made by Zwartjes; they spout the usual \u2018gallery nonsense\u2019. The art dealer appears most interested in the girlfriend. \u2018My latest creation\u2019 is how Amand introduces her. The guests who arrive thereafter are introduced in short, independent sections.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ronald Beer ()", "Trix Zwartjes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
