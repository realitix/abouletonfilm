In any case, the basic components of simple love and simple friendship (and a fortiori of Super-Love and Super-Friendship), that we have explored in depth (as evoked in my film, What is Love?), are still so poorly understood today by our contemporaries that even those who claim to be happily experiencing these run the risk of being quickly proven wrong by Life itself.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wV8ZAXFt1ABonRwtV0jL0IK3noZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
