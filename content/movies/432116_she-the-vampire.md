She has been condemned by the Devil to endless pain:she's dead but is forced to be still living for ever and ever. The story is set in undefined place and undetermined time; all the characters will meet, against their will, the charming vampire. This is a movie of gloomy and romantic atmospheres supported by an enthralling soundtrack and a photography with peculiar colours which call up again a good period for italian cinematography.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f5xR9l9AXYVTM5cXhUW8iYzHEEw.jpg", "actors": ["Elisabetta Principe (Carmilla, the vampire)", "Carlo Girelli (Marco Spaccesi)", "Mirko Riva (Samuel)", "Marta Bordino (Virginia Thompson)", "Samantha Jameson (1st victim)", "Walter Nichols (Herbert)", "Mara Leoni (2nd victim)", "Stefano Mazzocchi (Medium)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
