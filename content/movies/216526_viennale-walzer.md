Colorful spinning tops rotate on a reflecting surface, the sounds of a merry-go-round give way to familiar music. The camera pans upwards, revealing Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s motionless face. From off-screen, her thoughts contradict the sounds of Strauss: \u201cAh no, not those Viennese waltzes \u2026 I\u2019m thinking about film, about what happens every day. I\u2019m thinking about bread, salt, earth, corn, bread, the sea, salt.\u201d What follows are images (and sounds) of these essential things, a brief digression, with a musical transition between one take and the next, where there is time to take a closer look at things.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ZS7rvm4DgGF7xf0h4wjx2uBrp9.jpg", "actors": ["Agn\u00e8s Varda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
