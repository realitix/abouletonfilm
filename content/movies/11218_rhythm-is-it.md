The orchestra ventured out of the ivory tower of high culture into boroughs of low life for the sake of 250 youngsters. They had been strangers to classical music, but after arduous but thrilling preparation they danced to Stravinsky's 'Le Sacre du Printemps' ('The Rite of Spring'). Recorded with a breathtaking fidelity of sound, this film from Thomas Grube and Enrique S\u00e1nchez Lansch documents the stages of the Sacre project and offers deep insights into the rehearsals of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/65N5Ue8ey5Sq6p3nYKOfRco72bV.jpg", "actors": ["Royston Maldoom (himself)", "Susannah Broughton (herself)", "Marie Theinert (herself)", "Simon Rattle (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
