Domingo looking and singing like a god pouring out golden tones; Renato Bruson sounds, like the sublime Verdian Baritone that he was at that time; Nicolai Ghiaurov proves again that he was one of the greatest \"Verdi Basses\"; Mirella Freni shows that there was more to her than just being Mimi and Susannah-in fact I can remember reading that at the time of the premiere of this production that there were fist fights (not unusual in La Scala's gallery) between Mirella's many fans--between those fans that just wanting her to continue singing the light lyric repertoire that they were use to her singing and those that felt she should and could sing the lyric-spinto repertoire which, of course, she proved that,indeed, she could (She's still singing more than twenty years later). This performance captures some of the best Verdi singers of the time doing dear ole wonderful Giuseppi proud.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/luUYM1co8k97GctSWCRfam5R1d6.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Ernani)", "Mirella Freni (Elvira)", "Renato Bruson (Don Carlo)", "Nicolai Ghiaurov (Don Ruy Gomez de Silva)", "Riccardo Muti (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
