The cast makes a great performance, both, grandmother and son.\r\n\r\nMaybe, the weakest point is an inconclusive ending which, actually, fits perfectly but leaves too many open questions. Fits, because the whole movie is open, from the beginning to the end, since the point is bringing us to the reality of a devastated Iraq and how the population survives under a mountain of pain."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
