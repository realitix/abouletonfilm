The Lido is a large watering hole; we visit one afternoon with an orchestra playing, all sorts of stars and would-be stars sitting at tables near the pool alongside paying customers, and bathing beauties parading and diving. The Lido's manager, Reggy Denny, introduces the stars in the audience. He's sometimes interrupted by someone who does a bit, sings a song, or otherwise entertains: most of these are novelty acts. By the end, everyone's having a swell time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kXpEGkpguLeimmsTK1IisXZ6xOt.jpg", "actors": ["The Radio Rogues ()", "Eddie Bartell ()", "Jimmy Hollywood ()", "Henry Busse ()", "Henry Busse and His Orchestra ()", "Three Radio Rogues ()", "Henry Taylor ()", "Donald Grayson ()", "Arthur Lake ()", "The Fanchonettes ()", "Baby LeRoy ()", "Constance Bennett ()", "Johnny Mack Brown ()", "Buster Crabbe ()", "Reginald Denny ()", "Clark Gable ()", "Robert Montgomery ()", "Frank Shields ()", "Mary Stewart ()", "Bonnie Bannon ()", "Richard Barthelmess ()", "John Boles ()", "Diane Cook ()", "Lili Damita ()", "Cliff Edwards ()", "Sally Eilers ()", "Mary Lange ()", "Francis Lederer ()", "Mary Loos ()", "Ben Turpin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
