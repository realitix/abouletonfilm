Yumi Aoyama is the only person who knows the location, but her family dies one after another through curious incidents, as if the family were under a curse. Yumi is surprised by the ghost of a dead sister who looks the same as the grim figure who jumped into the old well alter stabbing herself with a sword. Fearful that a similar fate awaits her, Yumi seeks the help of her friend Kyoko. Later the ghost appears before Kyoko and her fianc\u00e9, Detective Nonomiya. In a haunted cave, Kyoko and Yumi are in deadly peril from those who seek treasures of the Aoyamas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/enqRE8tWPGKQQWJIeYYHRQ6BRR6.jpg", "actors": ["Y\u00f4ko Mihara (Ky\u00f4ko Niki)", "Reiko Seto (Yumi Aoyama)", "Masayo Banri (Kayo)", "Y\u00f4ichi Numata (Prof. Mizuki)", "Bunta Sugawara (Detective Nonomiya)", "Den Kunikata (Hibino)", "Y\u00f4ji Misaki (Manbei Itami)", "Jotaro Yuki ()", "Hiroshi Sugi ()", "Hideo Saeki ()", "Ky\u00f4ji Kokonoe ()", "Akiko Yamashita ()", "Eiko \u00d4hara ()", "Kuniko Yamamura ()", "Akio Shirakawa ()", "Keiji Oki ()", "Hiroaki Kurahashi ()", "Katsuya Uda ()", "Ichiro Takahashi ()", "Keiko Hamano ()", "Y\u00f4ko Mifune ()", "Fujie Satsuki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Xk5yM93I114"}
