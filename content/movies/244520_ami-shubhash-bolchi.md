It reflects on the life and principles of Subhash Chandra Bose, firebrand freedom fighter. It is all about the Bengali roots that is being forgotten so easily today by Bengalees all around the globe. Hopefully this movie will re-instill the affinity and respect that Bengalis ought to have about their origin, rich heritage and culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6rK61g3WCp7J9lVyq3S0TsIYlG5.jpg", "actors": ["Mithun Chakraborty (Debabrata Bose)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
