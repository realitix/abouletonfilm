It is a unique story that spans across half a century in China and connects the East with the West. It depicts Communist China's transformation as seen through the eyes of a Chinese gay man and people surrounding him. It seeks to explore humanity and morality; cross-cultural interaction in the rapid process of globalization; race; gender; religion and sexuality; interracial and cross-cultural prostitution; the lives and subcultures of marginal people as opposed to the mainstream society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9RyvZb5RBeMgIao9bMtN2zPO5Ly.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
