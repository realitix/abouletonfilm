Novotny is handsome, athletic and well-endowed. Higgins has chosen a romantic, lyrical style and the production values are very high. The sex scenes are stunning. This certainly sets the standard against which contemporary gay porn films should be measured.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kIRyr9BmA3xuLVu198xJGGfEDvM.jpg", "actors": ["Pavel Novotny (Hotelboy)", "Pavel Dubcek (First Guest)", "Jirka Bartok ()", "Karel Bartok ((as Karol Bartok))", "Boris Tomek (Delivery boy (as Bebe))", "Jirka Kalvoda ()", "Joachem Von Festung (as (Joachem von Festung))", "Pavel Korsakov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
