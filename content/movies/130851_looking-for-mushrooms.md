Conner and Leary occupied themselves with mushroom hunts in the Mexican countryside. It\u2019s not clear whether their hunts were successful. But Conner\u2019s staccato home-movies of their walks \u2013 combined with movies of previous mushroom hunts in San Francisco \u2013 became his film Looking for Mushrooms. The film rushes through the rustic landscape of rural Mexico, flitting past houses and through a crumbling graveyard.  Not to be confused with Conner's re-edited 1996 version of Looking for Mushroom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kJ0TQn3CGsJhsuKG1oJG54TCELV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [253541, 161897, 151085, 143521], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
