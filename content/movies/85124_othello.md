This may be due to the casting of Emil Jannings, to whom restraint and subtlety were strangers. Werner Krauss, of Cabinet of Dr. Caligari fame, is on hand as the duplicitous Iago. Appearing as the unfortunate Desdemona is Lea Von Lenkeffy, better known as Lya de Putti. Produced on an elaborate scale, Othello may not be true to the letter of Shakespeare, but is undeniably a smorgasbord of visual delights.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3WRUiSCR6srMuB4mVSiN6iF2DTj.jpg", "actors": ["Emil Jannings (Othello)", "Werner Krauss (Iago)", "Ica von Lenkeffy (Desdemona)", "Theodor Loos (Cassio)", "Ferdinand von Alten (Rodrigo)", "Friedrich K\u00fchne (Brabantio)", "Magnus Stifter (Montano)", "Lya De Putti (Emilia)", "Ludwig Rex ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
