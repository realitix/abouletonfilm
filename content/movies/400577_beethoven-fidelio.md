Who would honestly want to replace any of them? Who can fail to be overwhelmed with gratitude to own this disc?  If I continue to count our blessings, I might mention the splendid Robert Lloyd drawing us to a thrilling finale as Don Fernando; and Falk Struckmann a convincingly evil Pizarro.  So it is certainly not complaining, but fulfilling a reviewer's obligation to tell all, when I admit that Jennifer Welch-Babidge is little more than adequate as Marzelline. One might wish for a purer vocal line in this role - like a Bonney or an Isokoski.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ohbAovjnRXKKlehmhPkyXqoz1Is.jpg", "actors": ["Karita Mattila (Leonora)", "Ben Heppner (Florestan)", "Ren\u00e9 Pape (Rocco)", "Falk Struckmann (Don Pizarro)", "Jennifer Welch-Babidge (Marzelline)", "Matthew Polenzani (Jaquino)", "Robert Lloyd (Fernando)", "Eric Cutler (1er Gefangener)", "Alfred Walker (2e Gefangener)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
