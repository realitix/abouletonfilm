The series gets cited on lists of action yakuza films or woman avenger films, but once the films are actually viewed, it is quickly obvious they are not generally about action except in the nominal sense of acts of gambling. And while Ogin is in fact sometimes motivated by revenge, she is not as a rule a martial artist or a killer, & this series tends to place its female hero as far away from the \"action babe\" method as she can get. Ogin is an honest dealer in the criminal underworld of yakuza-run gambling. She is samurai-like in that she sets out to become Japan's number one dealer, much as a samurai might go on his \"warrior's pilgrimage\" to become Japan's number one swordsman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4p0spaRchDm82kfcVILRm9pYHnH.jpg", "actors": ["Ky\u00f4ko Enami (Ogin)", "Y\u00fbsuke Kawazu ()", "Fumio Watanabe ()", "Hiroshi Minami ()", "Bontar\u00f4 Miake ()", "Osamu Sakai ()", "K\u00f4ichi Mizuhara ()", "Rieko Sumi ()", "Kazuko Wakamatsu ()", "Kyomi Sakura ()", "Yoshir\u00f4 Kitahara ()", "Eiichi Takamura ()", "Akira Natsuki ()", "K\u00f4ji Fujiyama ()", "Jun Osanai ()", "Kenichi Tani ()", "Tetsuya Watanabe ()", "Kuniichi Takami ()", "Shun Tsuda ()", "Shin Minatsu ()", "Tadashi Date ()", "Tsutomu Nakata ()", "Chizuru Ko ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
