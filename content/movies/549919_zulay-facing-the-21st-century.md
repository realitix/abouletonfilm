Working the land and making textiles to sell, Zulay\u2019s industrious family sent all of their daughters to school \u2014 at the time an unusual move in Quinchuqui \u2014 and raised an intelligent, independent daughter whose literacy, business sense and introduction to the Prelor\u00e1ns led her to try her luck in the States.
