Based on the true story where the most of the film was the 13 hour long armed battle event took place in Libya, 2012. I remember the middle-east's protest over the western films, this story is set in the same time when the islamic terrorists targeted the American diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, but six brave men stood and fought against the uprising.\r\n\r\nIt is an American patriotic film, but because of the hatred over their own countrymen Michael Bay, they're surely missing a nearly a war masterpiece. The rest of the world saw it as a fine film and appreciated that. If you haven't seen it yet, I say just don't ignore it. It was a well made realistic war film, the actors were amazing and the scenes were suspenseful to spectacular. Definitely one of the best in this theme.\r\n\r\nIt was simply focused on the armed conflict between the two forces, so it won't reasons out us how and where it all began, because that might take another film to tell the tale. That's really a very clever writing. In this 150 minute long film, the first act was full of characters and story development. Then begins the gun fight that commences from the dust hours till the dawn breaks out. With many twists in the narration during confrontation, surely not a film to be missed.\r\n\r\n8/10"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "If you fancy yourself a big swingin' dick yank, then I'd recommend you watch _13 Hours_, but of course, you already have.\r\n\r\nI can move past the xenophobia and jingoism pretty easily, even the typical Bay tropes don't ruin a movie for me, but what I find difficult to abide is boredom, and with _13 Hours_, I personally found that in spades.\r\n\r\nThough it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, though I didn't care about any of the characters, and though I am giving this film a negative review, I can still say it's Michael Bay's best work in years.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._"}], "recommandations_id": [193756, 300673, 296524, 267860]}
