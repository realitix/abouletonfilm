Despite being a socialist, a single parent, and an agnostic, Dr. Bachelet succeeds in becoming the first woman President of Chile, one of South America's most conservative nations, and captures the attention of the world's press with her singularly feminine way of making politics.  For a year, Chilean filmmaker, Mar\u00eda Elena Word, followed this once anonymous doctor and socialist militant as she travelled through Chile on the campaign trail, discovering some of the forces motivating Dr. Bachelet as well as examining the high points in her personal and family life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q2jQgEju3G3UJjt0km5X3T1Kd5Y.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle Bachelet (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qfj9eua_9u0"}
