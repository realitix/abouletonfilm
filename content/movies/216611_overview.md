'Overview' is a short film that explores this perspective through interviews with astronauts who have experienced the Overview Effect. The film also features insights from commentators and thinkers on the wider implications and importance of this understanding for humanity as a whole, and especially its relevance to how we meet the tremendous challenges facing our planet at this time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3hiSE0QMpPnEwR6GzwtXmLkEkQg.jpg", "actors": ["Edgar Mitchell ()", "Ron Garan ()", "Nicole Stott ()", "Jeff Hoffman ()", "Shane Kimbrough ()", "Frank White ()", "David Loy ()", "David Beaver ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
