Are we destined to go the way of the dinosaur? Killer asteroids have long played a role in science fiction. But when a fireball exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013, the world learned that the threat is real. On average, NASA finds a new potentially hazardous asteroid every day... and there are still many we haven\u2019t found. Many of these space rocks have the power to destroy cities, and some are big enough to wipe out human civilization. On the other hand, they could hold the secrets to the origin of our solar system \u2013 and might just be the key to the survival of the human race. In the movies, when an asteroid is headed for Earth, there\u2019s always a team of heroes that comes to the rescue and saves the day. But in real life, who can tame these hurtling space rocks? Who can save us from Asteroid Apocalypse \u2013 and, just maybe, take us outward into the final frontier?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/61g5jhHWAUdTssA7By62smqPL8h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
