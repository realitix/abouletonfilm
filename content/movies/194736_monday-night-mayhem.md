Executive Roone Arledge (John Heard) recruits former Dallas Cowboys quarterback 'Dandy' Don Meredith (Brad Beyer), along with Keith Jackson (Shuler Hensley), and the combative Howard Cosell (John Turturro) as commentators for the broadcasts, which become funny, odd trio events to millions of viewers. Jackson departs the show after the first year to take over the network's focus on college football, and former New York Giants star Frank Gifford (Kevin Anderson) takes his place, ruffling Cosell's feathers. Then things get really crazy!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zety0zMEn0A1r4zef1wWdvcXxsv.jpg", "actors": ["John Turturro (Howard Cosell)", "John Heard (Roone Arledge)", "Brad Beyer (Don Meredith)", "Kevin Anderson (Frank Gifford)", "Shuler Hensley (Keith Jackson)", "Nicholas Turturro (Chet Forte)", "Patti LuPone (Emmy Cosell)", "Jay Thomas (Pete Rozelle)", "Eli Wallach (Leonard Goldenson)", "Zak Orth (Don Ohlmeyer)", "Glenn Howerton (Dick Ebersol)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
