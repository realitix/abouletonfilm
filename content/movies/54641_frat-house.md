The opening fraternity, that drove the filmmakers out of the college and the town, is the Beta Chi fraternity on the State University of New York College at Oneonta campus in Oneonta New York. Beta Chi is an unrecognized fraternity in Oneonta, and was kicked off the Oneonta campus after reports of severe hazing. It continues to operate as a rogue, unrecognized chapter in the town to this day", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hNnCNZrtxdFyON5UDzCI9SR7wcf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [35567], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
