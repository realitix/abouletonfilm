At the opening of the Munich Opera Festival 1998, Tristan und Isolde was staged in what is now the ninth new production at the Bavarian State Opera since its world premi\u00e8re. Director Peter Konwitschny worked together with stage and costume designer Johannes Leiacker a team already well known in Munich for its much-respected Parsifal. Zubin Mehta conducted, shortly before being called to be General Music Director at the Bavarian State Opera. The title parts were interpreted by the American tenor Jon Frederic West, widely known for his Wagner-roles and Waltraud Meier, one of the greatest Isoldes of our time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/el081chYATrnEwwOEEQMzePHvm7.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Fredric West ()", "Kurt Moll ()", "Waltraud Meier ()", "Bernd Weikl ()", "Marjana Lipov\u0161ek ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
