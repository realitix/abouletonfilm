This one-hour documentary takes viewers behind the frenzied headlines to put the killings in their true perspective. Leading crime writers John Silvester and Andrew Rule analyse the causes and effects of the decade-long war. They investigate the reasons it began, why it was allowed to escalate and flourish for so long and point to what lessons, if any, have been learned by law makers and breakers alike.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kNPq7W2YaZYsZvl0B3NZhAwy1XS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
