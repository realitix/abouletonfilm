Tamar is an amazingly talented but very quiet and insecure girl, who leaves behind her home and all she knows, changing herself unrecognizably -from her looks to her attitude- to brace herself for a dangerous mission to help a loved-one. Asaf, a clumsy, naive, and very shy boy working a boring summer job at City Hall, is given quite a mission himself : to take an uncontrollable stray dog from the pound, put it on a leash, and let it lead him back to its owners to be fined. The more stories Asaf hears about this extraordinary girl, the more he falls for her, and as he and Dinkah continue their journey Asaf becomes aware that Tamar is in grave danger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b6WqdIT6KjxBBzyKBNBDg1nS5py.jpg", "actors": ["Bar Belfer (Tamar)", "Yonatan Bar-Or (Asaf)", "Yuval Mendelson (Shai)", "Rinat Matatov (Shelly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
