As most of the inhabitants are illiterate, they have no choice but to ask for the help of Ant\u00f4nio Bi\u00e1, a man who has been ostracized ever since it was discovered that he had sent out letters with lies about their reputations as a way to keep his job in Jav\u00e9's seldom-used post office. He now has the task of documenting people's memories of how the city was founded, yet each inhabitant has his or her own version of what happened.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6t3NEvPARLqEzGgvu3OxZ3zTnmp.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Dumont ()", "Nelson Dantas ()", "Nelson Xavier ()", "Matheus Nachtergaele ()", "Rui Rezende ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
