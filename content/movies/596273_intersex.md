But what about intersex people who do not fit into either category? Since Vincent Guillot, as an adult, discovered the word that defines him \u2014intersexual \u2013 he has never stopped looking for people like him in an urgent quest to understand himself. The German women artist Ins A Kromminga realised that she was different as a teenager. Born and raised as a girl, her body began to acquire male characteristics in puberty. Her eloquent drawings speak of the trauma that is inflicted on intersex people. With joyful determination and a great sense of humour, the characters in R\u00e9gine Abadia\u2019s documentary fight for the emancipation of a minority that is invisible and beaten and bruised by life.
