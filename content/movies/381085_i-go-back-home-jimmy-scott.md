Ralf wanted to realize this project ever since he had heard Jimmy\u2018s voice singing for the first time 30 years ago. But it took a personal tragedy to finally put his thoughts into action. Meeting Jimmy Scott at the age of 85 years living secluded and chairbound after an accident in Las Vegas Ralf was shocked by Jimmy\u2018s surprisingly bad health condition. Will he be able to put his plan into reality?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vqyFhjguTwCyv7nHsiBXzpegUHi.jpg", "actors": ["David Sanborn ()", "Joe Pesci ()", "Quincy Jones ()", "Jimmy Scott (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
