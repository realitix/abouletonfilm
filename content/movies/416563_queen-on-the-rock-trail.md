Christmas 1975 was a remarkable time for the band Queen as their groundbreaking single Bohemian Rhapsody held the number one chart position in the UK for nine weeks. Showcasing the unique talent of Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon, the complex operatic section of Bohemian Rhapsody could not be performed live so a video was produced, which changed the face of music, quite literally, for all time. Never again would a single be released without a promotional video to back it up and Queen was forever associated with both visual and musical spectacle. However, there\u2019s a great deal more to Queen than Bohemian Rhapsody and On the Rock Trail will provide an incredible insight into this luminescent Rock phenomenon that took the world by storm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a4jKxJzdY1LwLBJPdU8yGPSFjcX.jpg", "actors": ["John Deacon ()", "Roger Taylor ()", "Brian May ()", "Freddie Mercury ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
