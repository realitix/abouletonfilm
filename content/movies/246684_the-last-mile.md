At age thirty, newly sober, out walking his dog he decided to take what became the first of many runs. \u201cNo exercise I have ever tried did I really enjoy. So what is the difference with running? It can be so hard but still I crave it. Using up hours every week but still I feel it\u2019s important to keep balance.

Why do we run?\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ymCk8uTF0vranAPlu4sjoLXchZE.jpg", "actors": ["Amby Burfoot ()", "Tommy Danger ()", "Joseph Nzau ()", "Justin Gillette ()", "Ernest Kebenei ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2cpi7IWFPt8"}
