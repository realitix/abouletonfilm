I also like the mid-70s fashions & d\u00e9cor; and there are a few laughs or well-done scenes, like the great conference room sequence. \r\n\r\nBut, with the exception of Eve Arden as a cereal mogul, there\u2019s zero emphasis in the female department. In other words, the story takes place at a Southern Cal college, but there are no women, except in a very peripheral sense. Someone might argue that this is a film for kids. Yes, real LITTLE kids; and maybe adults on a nostalgia trip.        \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 32 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, Glendale and Pasadena, California. WRITERS: Joseph L. McEveety and Herman Groves.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"}], "recommandations_id": [39526, 29228, 231259, 104297], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
