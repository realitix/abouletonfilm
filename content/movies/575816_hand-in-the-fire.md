Him.... He's a flirt, a lover of scrubs, burning butts and sizzling cocks. A son worthy of the god Ra, adept of Vulcan and his hammer blows. When he's around everything gets hot, and he's always being caught red-handed. A Cadinot film which is all heat and flames! The pine forests are ablaze, and the campers on fire. The heat of a pyromaniac seeds disorder amongst the authorities.
