Russian hooligans injured over 100 English supporters, beating two into a coma, and it raised serious concerns ahead of Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup. Filmmaker Alex Stockley von Statzer travels to Russia to experience the country's football fan culture first hand. Featuring footage filmed in Marseille in 2016, rare interviews with members of some of the most feared firms like the Spartak Gladiators and Orel Butchers, and new footage of an organised fight for wannabe recruits, this show uncovers a world where brutal violence has become a mark of honour and a symbol of newly resurgent Russian masculinity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tGFWI3pj4wmSKXrTzoPEVHDRUiB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
