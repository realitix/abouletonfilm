But far from a John Wayne, this hero is caught and brutally beaten and left to die, only to be saved by a prostitute that has also suffered under the hand of this group of desperados. The only one possible to stand up to the shooter is another solitary man who joins with the notorious family although he is deputized as the town's sherif.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/viIfcEY5wauEFS8kT0kf1dBhmI4.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Dudikoff (Michael Atherton)", "Randy Travis (Kyle Tapert)", "Valerie Wildman (Wendy)", "Andrew Stevens (Jacob Finch / Narrator)", "William Smith (Jerry Krants)", "Libby George (Gina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "F2ptqKcPLsE"}
