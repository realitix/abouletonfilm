Not that it's perfect by any means, but its excellences--most especially Anna Netrebko's electrifying singing and acting of Elvira--banish carping about other aspects of this memorable night at the opera. Netrebko is fragile from the start, her facial expressions and hand movements immediately conveying the girl's vulnerability. She has a mad scene in each act; the first when she realizes her fianc\u00e9 has disappeared with another woman, the third, in the final act, a brief relapse when her returned fianc\u00e9 is taken by the army to be executed. But it's in the second act that the real fireworks occur, with a Mad Scene that rivals Donizetti's Lucia for bel canto primacy. Here, Elvira is first heard off-stage, after the chorus has informed us that she's deranged. She enters wearing her wedding gown and begins Qui la voce in a voice as frail as her psyche.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cOm2I17bFqQMKVGsO4hPuBf3ryK.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Cutler (Lord Arturo Talbo)", "Anna Netrebko (Elvira)", "John Relyea (Sir Giorgio)", "Valerian Ruminski (Lord Gualtiero Valton)", "Franco Vassallo (Sir Riccardo Forth)", "Maria Zifchak (Enrichetta di Francia)", "Eduardo Valdes (Sir Bruno Roberton)", "Patrick Summers (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
