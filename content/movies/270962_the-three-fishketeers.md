Toby, bright-eyed and spunky, Finner, aristocratic and thoughtful, and Gillis, a big \"galumphing\" guppy who calmly takes everything in stride. Meeting a \"damsel\" clearly not in distress, the would-be heroes comically try to help her recover a large pearl. But it isn't long before all four of them are swimming for their lives, and The Three Fishketeers finally learn what heroism really is.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Adam Dykstra (Toby (voice))", "Russ Harris (Gillas (voice))", "G.
