A. Pennebaker was meant to be One A.M., as in \u201cone American movie\u201d; but Godard quit the project and the U.S., where to his dismay he discovered that revolution wasn\u2019t imminent, and Pennebaker edited Godard\u2019s material, to which he and Richard Leacock even added a bit more, releasing the result as One P.M., as in \u201cone parallel movie.\u201d It\u2019s a stunning mixture of cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9, political theater, and interviews of key sixties figures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21TMN4joFT0I9uUjNCrXUolZ9hC.jpg", "actors": ["Rip Torn (Himself)", "Tom Hayden (Himself)", "Eldridge Cleaver (Himself)", "Amiri Baraka (Himself)", "Tom Luddy (Himself)", "Marty Balin (Himself)", "Grace Slick (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163312, 413043, 89494, 123406], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
