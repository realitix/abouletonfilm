Only one soldier refuses to take part in it and reports this incident to his superior, who dismisses it as simple wartime incident. As a consequence for his report, the soldier has to fear for his life. Later, the perpetrators are convicted, although subsequent appeals reduce their sentences significantly.  The plot takes place in a Bavarian forest and reenacts a real war crime that happened in the Vietnam war. The soldiers wear US uniforms, have authentic names but speak with a pronounced Bavarian accent - a conscious directing decision known as Brechtian distancing effect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7tJ0HCo40uaTSIp9NwmfMuM19Lp.jpg", "actors": ["Friedrich von Thun (Sergeant Tony Meserve)", "Hartmut Becker (Corporal Ralph Clarke)", "Wolfgang Fischer (Private Rafe)", "Ewald Precht (Private Diaz)", "Michael Verhoeven (Private Erickson)", "Eva Mattes (Phan Ti Mao)", "Gustl Bayrhammer (Captain Vorst)", "Senta Berger (Senta)", "Hanna Burgwitz (Josefine)", "Rolf Zacher (Rowan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
