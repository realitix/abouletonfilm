Maria Bamford, as even casual fans will admit, is not \"most people.\" There's no telling what her Plan A might have entailed (perhaps a one-woman rendition of \"Grey Gardens?\"), but Bamford's Plan B turns out to be a virtuoso, one-woman performance of a self-imposed stint in Northwoods exile. Filmed live at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis, the extra-packed DVD now out from Stand Up! Records has an intimate and theatrical flavor that may feel unexpected to some of Bamford's followers, but skillfully weaves together the most well-wrought portions of her repertoire. More focused than her usual stand-up routine, in Plan B Bamford takes on the story of her own Hollywood life, viewed from the much safer - and possibly much weirder - climes of Duluth, MN.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k1hLLwUVHZgwObwhTFriy0ZzAF8.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Bamford (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
