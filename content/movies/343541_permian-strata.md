This excellent tome contains close analysis by Bruce Jenkins of film-school staples like A Movie and Looking For Mushrooms as well as of later works like Valse Triste and Take the 5:10 to Dreamland. The 1969 film is called Permian Strata, a title which works in conjunction with the images and the song that makes up the film's soundtrack to form a colossal pun. So often experimental film gets pigeonholed as overly serious, boring, stuffy, or requiring an expertise in filmmaking processes to fully appreciate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jArPtBBH8OdFCnXwKKO89ziSWav.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
