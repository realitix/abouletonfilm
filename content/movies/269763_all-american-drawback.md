In other words, Charlie is a dummy in more ways than one. Beyond other problems Coach Bergen has with Charlie concerning the coach's girlfriend Joan, Coach Bergen has to get Charlie prepared to pass an exam administered by the Dean. Instead of cheating like he usually does, Charlie has his own way of dealing with the exam.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ktJ6a61xI0RQ20Bd7K8wuYhDySL.jpg", "actors": ["Edgar Bergen (Coach Bergen)", "Gerrie Worthing (Joan)", "June Carr (Dumb Blonde)", "David Burns (Game Announcer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
