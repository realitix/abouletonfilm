Solanas directed this Argentine-French-Italian-German drama with allegorical reflections of Argentina's past history. The film is divided into four chapters (\"The Mirror,\" \"The Waiting Men,\" \"Oblivion,\" \"Howls\") with subchapters (\"Punishments,\" \"Rewards,\" \"Obstinacy\"). A black cloud brings 1600 days of rain to Buenos Aires, while traffic and pedestrians move backwards. Aging actor Max (Eduardo Pavlovsky) runs the Mirror Theater in a former fish market, but lack of funding means a possible demolition. Max is attracted to Brazilian dancer Fulo (Angela Correa), who worries about her daughter back home. Amid political corruption and police brutality, Max's elderly colleague Enrique leads a protest for unpaid old-age pensions. The pensioners succeed in their demands, only to learn from a government official that no money is available to pay them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6zWBzspg05idUfi1hN59rljNPWt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
