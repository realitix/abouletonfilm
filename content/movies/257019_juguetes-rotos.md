The film visits a popular singer, a champion prize fighter who has been committed to an asylum, and an ancient matador returning to the ring among many others to probe the anomie that comes with fame as a privilege at its apex and a curse at its bitter end.  This film treads somewhere between what could have been a legitimate \"essay film\" and a commercial \"where are they now\" featurette. The treasure hunt for the \"campe\u00f3n maldito\" or \"estrella maldita\" (cursed champ or star) seems to be a fixture of Spanish popular culture today (as of course it is in a coarser way today in Anglo-American culture).  In any event, this is an interesting instance of this.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ixn1DudjbRvthJXjrWZ8SuMDQEm.jpg", "actors": ["Rosita Pinedo ()", "Justo Mas\u00f3 ()", "Guillermo Gorostiza ()", "Paulino Uzcudum ()", "Hilario Mart\u00ednez ()", "Ricardo Al\u00eds ()", "Luis Vallesp\u00edn ()", "Eusebio Librero ()", "Eduardo L\u00f3pez ()", "Francisco D\u00edaz 'Pacorro' ()", "Marina Torres ()", "Nicanor Villalta ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [110921, 113989, 204178, 260793], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
