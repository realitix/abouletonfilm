The film was created to conclude the story of the FamiKamen Rider that began in You Can Play This!. The story began as a running plot line in You Can Play This!, with a movie Kickstarter funded and in pre-production. However, following Justin Carmical's tragic passing, the saga was incomplete and the story left hanging. Kaylyn and Josh took it upon themselves to write a new script and see the project to fruition, and a rough cut of the film was screened at Magfest 2015. The full film was released online April 15th, 2015.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5tTdLugGlRDCVbGSBJZFy3V1iJa.jpg", "actors": ["Justin Carmical (JewWario)", "Lewis Lovhaug ()", "Kaylyn Dicksion (MarzGurl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
