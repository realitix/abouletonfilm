It is more meditative. It has a somewhat slower pace. I tried to let the cut-outs float more gracefully. Again, John Davis' music forms an integral part of the meditation. I have used that word 'meditation' because that is how some very astute friends of mine described it to me on first viewing. The approach is partly planned, partly improvised under the camera. There has been little or no editing outside the camera for many years in my animation. All effects are done in camera.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/viaJuqCixesZublen97chzI7XTC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
