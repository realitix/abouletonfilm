She has left her family, her husband and son and their house on the Baltic Sea behind her. She spends her nights in a Warsaw hotel room and her days driving around the unfamiliar city. When she runs out of cash, she hatches a plan: An ad in the newspaper \u2013 sex for money. Edyta never lets things get that far though, as she drugs her clients and then uses their apartments as a refuge for the night. Then she meets an artist, Patryk. A smidgen of luck and Edyta can no longer maintain her dismissive attitude. In this enthralling character study, Tomasz Wasilewski uses filmic minimalism to ensure that glances and gestures say more than words. He portrays a lonely woman in both fragility and strength, using precise image composition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vfY0cKefZpRYhSTXamPFF8TL72Y.jpg", "actors": ["Katarzyna Herman (Ewa - Edyta)", "Tomasz Tyndyk (Patryk)", "Agata Buzek (Klaudia)", "Miros\u0142aw Zbrojewicz (Jacek)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
