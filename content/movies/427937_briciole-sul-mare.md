For a strange twist of fate, one day he falls asleep and he wakes up in the waters of the beautiful and sunny Sicily. Here he will meet new people and among them, Salvo, a young boy who is about to face his future life. Unfortunately he will also be the witness of a murder that will complicate even more his stay on the island.
