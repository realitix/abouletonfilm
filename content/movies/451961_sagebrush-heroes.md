Reporter Connie Pearson (Constance Worth) persuades them to visit Marty Jones (Elvin Fields), a fatherless boy, who has been sent to a boy's home after stealing Steve's wallet, ran by Tom Goodwin (Forrest Taylor.) Marty tells Steve that the home is a phony and is a front for cattle rustlers. Steve passes the information on to Connie, who doesn't believe him, so he and Jimmy wire the ranch for sound. They are caught and Goodwin turns them over to Sheriff Barnes (Edmund Cobb), and then plans to skip the country", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/56g6eoApueJmACXCe8l7bnZrkyE.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Starrett (Steve Randall)", "Dub Taylor (Cannonball)", "Constance Worth (Connie Pearson)", "Jimmy Wakely (Musician Cowhand Jimmy)", "Ozie Waters (Musician Calico Jones)", "Elvin Field (Marty Jones (as Elvin Fields))", "Bobby Larson (Tim)", "Forrest Taylor (Tom Goodwin)", "Joel Friedkin (Doctor Webb)", "Lane Chandler (Colton)", "Paul Conrad (Henchman Brady (as Paul Zaremba))", "Eddie Laughton (Henchman Layton)", "John Tyrrell (Finley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
