The film's hero is a very earnest, somewhat pompous, but endearing dog called Wally. A \"professional\" in home safety, Wally is assigned to a house with an infant whose parents have little safety consciousness. Accidents and near-accidents succeed each other with lightning speed, constantly putting Wally to the test.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/soBIcuOhTUgxtpKFeCrnE0oNhZK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
