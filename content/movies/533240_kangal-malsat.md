Fyataroos join hands with Choktors. Advised by Calcutta's progenitors Dandabayash (ageless primordial talking crow) and an Indo-colonial half-breed Begum Johnson(1732-1818) erupt a historic insurrection. They jointly launch guerrilla attacks against the Government. Skulls dance in crematoria and flying-discs flutter in the skies and cry anarchy, resident ghosts gossip and prattle, and the police is in total confusion. Government is forced to surrender and offer a peace proposal to the joint force. The film dissects almost everything wrong in the city with a cinematic knife sharpened on trenchant farce and fantasy. It is an anarchist film.  \u2014Anonymous", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kAL2zY5wpSk5fyxJAflCrRXgdFP.jpg", "actors": ["Kabir Suman (Dandobayosh)", "Kaushik Ganguly (Marshal Bondi)", "Kamalika Banerjee (Bechamani)", "Shantilal Mukherjee (Madan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OjM24RWUcvc"}
