One is an L.A. singer, formerly of the Platters; one is a petty thief from Philly; one teaches school in a small Georgia town. Each claims to be the widow of long-dead doo-wop singer-songwriter Frankie Lyman, and each wants years of royalties due to his estate, money Levy has never shared. During an ensuing civil trial, flashbacks tell the story of each one's life with Lyman, a boyish, high-pitched, dynamic performer, lost to heroin. Slowly, the three wives establish their own bond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nZ7UYOQ50C38wdWqOcNxCxZ6GB1.jpg", "actors": ["Vivica A.
