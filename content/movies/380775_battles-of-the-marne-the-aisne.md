In a master piece of military diplomacy he persuaded Filed Marshal French to join the Attack on the exposed flank of the Germans as it wheeled to the east of Paris.

The Germans held firm and Field Marshal French ordered the BEF to dig-in as a temporary measure but the line moved but little here in the next four years.With neither army able to make headway against modern small arms, the machine gun and quick firing artillery in a conventional frontal battle, the armies raced to redeploy into the uncontested ground north to the sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zr2BCT7oQcoyDUb7p3KuB2wsyZP.jpg", "actors": ["Ed Church (Presenter)", "Mike Peters (Presenter)", "Andrew Duff (Presenter)", "Paul Oldfield (Presenter)", "Tom Dormer (Presenter)", "Tim Saunders (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Ub230NXc3II"}
