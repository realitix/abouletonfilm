His many personas include Dr. Octagon, under which he released 1996's DR. OCTAGONOCOLOGIST, a futuristic masterpiece that flouted traditional hip hop mores in favor of intriguingly disruptive, warped rhymes. He is also the Black Elvis, Dr. Doom, Mr. Gerbik, and Rhythm X, and is formerly of the Bronx group the Ultramagnetic MCs, with whom he first established himself as a rapper who pushes the envelope and is not afraid to be critical of the system within which he operates. This DVD release features multiple interviews with the artist, as well as live concert footage. Keith takes his audiences on a tour of Manhattan and the Bronx. Keith also explains why he loves seltzer water.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2hwdjtsKPUNrn2OLkrf2RpvO5od.jpg", "actors": ["Kool Keith ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
