In spite of my Classics degree, I won't complain about the divergences from recorded fact. The film is clearly meant to be a fantasy on historical themes instead of a faithful account of the event. Rather, what irked me was the hammy dialogue. There were the tropes of recent Hollywood battle scenes: warriors on the good guys' side defending themselves with little exertion as they trade silly quips about how they've got each other's backs. A queen gives an address to a council that is all melodrama -- are we back in George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" prequels?\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed <i>Sin City</i>, a film with a similar green screen approach, I thought that <i>300</i> would be enjoyable on the basis of its special effects, but alas it wasn't. For one, the cinematography is claustrophobic. All outdoor scenes but one were filmed with a green screen, and the digital backdrops add no depth. Even when supposedly standing on the Greek coast under a big sky, everyone seems like they are just standing around in a fairly small room. Also, the fight scenes seem more primitive than considering that this film followed years after <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>.\r\n\r\nThe little I can recommend <i>300</i> for is the variety of demonic monsters and exotic costumed assassins that fill the Persian army. As I said, this is a fantasy on historical themes, and the additions are often interesting. Still, I had a hard time sitting through the whole film."}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Leather underwear and a cape is honestly such a Look\u2122.\r\n\r\n_300_ cops a lot of flak for being all style and no substance, and I'm not gonna stand here and lie to you by refuting that. What I will say however, is that style over substance does not inherently make a movie bad. _300_ is a lot of fun, you get what's going on, and there's some genuine rewatch value.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time."}], "recommandations_id": [53182, 604, 27578, 98], "youtube_key": "UrIbxk7idYA"}
