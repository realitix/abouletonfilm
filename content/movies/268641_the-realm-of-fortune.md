He works announcing things along the town (\"The priest lost his cow, if someone sees it ...\"). He is very interested in the cock fighting. One day a man gives him a loser cock, thinking to give him something to eat, but instead he takes care of the animal and it becomes a winner cock. He begins to win some money. La Caponera, a very good looking singer, earlier avoided him but now she uses her coquetry to gain some drinks. He thinks she is his talisman so he marries her when he becomes rich, taking her apart from the show-biz, so she begins to feel very unhappy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8OH4rDbRkiNoJkoRoO3ZX0h7gvh.jpg", "actors": ["Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz (Dionisio Pinz\u00f3n)", "Blanca Guerra (La Caponera)", "Alejandro Parodi (Lorenzo Benavides)", "Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez (La Pinzona)", "Socorro Avelar (Madre de Dionisio)", "Juan Antonio Llanes (Cura de San Miguel)", "Carlos Card\u00e1n (Don Isabel)", "Lol\u00f3 Navarro (Do\u00f1a Iris)", "Edmundo Barahona (Merenguero)", "Raymundo G\u00f3mez Cruz (Quitamantas)", "Mar\u00eda Barber (Monja)", "Jorge Feg\u00e1n (Juez Veedor)", "Alfonso God\u00ednez (Amarrador)", "Emilio Ebergenyi (Padrino)", "Jos\u00e9 Ruvinskis (Padrino)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
