According to the guidelines, the data were immediately isolated and sent to be re-evaluated in order to classify the registered events and to develop further options for protective and preventive efforts. A few days later, the tranquility of the sleeping \"Xonasu\" was torn apart by sharp, blazing fragments of multiple meteors. The area around the \"Xonasu\" faltered - a wave of interruptions and failures rapidly swept through the heart of its systems ... and one of the errors launched the sequence to awake the Supreme Operator of Xonasu. A little later - all was quiet and still.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bVWXq7xY4ydXrA0au3iSMEw2wtz.jpg", "actors": ["Yamamoto Akari (Exaella / Piku (voice))", "Oki Mikito (Ken / Clouds / Pilot (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "14wyTrz23io"}
