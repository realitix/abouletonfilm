Nora's uncle Eberhard, however, believes the two belong together and comes up with a plan to bring the two back together again: as a lawyer, who is processing the divorce, he explains to them that the paperwork for the divorce is completed, but will only go into effect once they undertake a reconciliation attempt. For the first reconciliation meeting, Eberhard enlists the help of his friend Christa and together, they turn Nora into such a hot tamale, that Peter burns with jealousy that any other man might look at her. At the second meeting of the two, which takes place a year later (how long do divorces in Nazi Germany take?!?!), Nora plays the girl abandoned by everyone. In the interim, she's given birth to Peter's son -- which apparently does not count as a reconciliation -- and Peter has become a successful composer. When Nora again disappears after this meeting, Peter does all he can to win her back.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tuDcY4jLz6UUwLt140sowPaVlDW.jpg", "actors": ["Leny Marenbach (Nora Bagrat)", "Grethe Weiser (Mausi Blanke)", "Hilde Hildebrand (Frau Conradi)", "Rudolf Platte (Karl, Diener bei Bagrat)", "Johannes Riemann (Peter Bagrat, Komponist)", "Gerhard Dammann (Brieftr\u00e4ger)", "Ralph Arthur Roberts (Justizrat Windhorst)", "Hilde Weissner (Christa Andersen)", "Willi Schur (Toby)", "Angelo Ferrari (2.
