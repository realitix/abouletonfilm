Their previous GMM show dates back to 2007 but now the German power metal giants are back for take three. Grave Digger is about solid riffs, ripping solos, a driving rhythm section and of course frontman Chris Boltendahl\u2019s typical raw vocals. Ever since the early 80s, Grave Digger has regaled us with tales of Excalibur, the crusades, Wagner\u2019s operas and even Jesus Christ. Last year, they added \u2018Clash of the Gods\u2019 to their repertoire. The riffage is appropriately unrelenting and the album as a whole is reminiscent of their excellent Rheingold CD (2003). They\u2019ve got more than enough ammunition for a scorching live show so be sure to check them out this summer!  .", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
