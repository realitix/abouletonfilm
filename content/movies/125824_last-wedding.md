Noah and Zipporah marry after a brief courtship. She wants to be a singer and stalls out when she fails. He's working hard at a business that may go under. Sarah and Shane are architects; he can't handle her success at a downtown firm. Leslie is a librarian, sour and prickly; her mate, Peter, is a college teacher whose head is turned by a student. Can any of these couples sort things out and stay together? Should they?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8W9NxTA9AwJLdTdhud8MGmUjnNc.jpg", "actors": ["Molly Parker (Sarah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
