The \"game\" is played by opening the box, unfolding the board and placing shapes on it that you manipulate with your hands. There are no winners or losers in this game; the fun is in the creative way the forms unfold. Features a score by Luigi Alleman and music by Ravi Shankar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bYdcskRsIYAgTb2uX6J6HV9Orsp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
