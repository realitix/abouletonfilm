Her dog Toto finds a woodcutter made of tin, so the Scarecrow oils him up and he accompanies them. They watch some animals reproduce before being ushered into the Emerald City by singing suits of armor and a lavish parade of overweight cops before meeting the Wizard, a devious little man who transforms eggs into uncontrollable forms, much to Billina's dismay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3mE6JKAbAnBY4WXqg1ZqcBHoMaf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [53526, 235169, 145961, 145963], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
