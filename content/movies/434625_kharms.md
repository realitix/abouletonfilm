He loves women but they don\u2019t always understand him. Constantly without money and out of touch with reality.  The elegant fop Daniil Yuvachov names himself Kharms- a name just as effective as his appearance. An habitu\u00e9 of unending literary get-togethers and a lover of scandal. Living in society he is completely separate from it. Kharms throws down a gauntlet to his time, audaciously hurling himself into the vortex of reality, just as vague and arbitrary, with the same contradictions, as represented by his spirit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AcHchjKxxWzXl5PDHcCLn7Vs48u.jpg", "actors": ["Wojciech Urbanski ()", "Aist\u0117 Dir\u017ei\u016bt\u0117 ()", "Darius Gumauskas ()", "Artyom Semakin ()", "Tatyana Shapovalova ()", "Grigory Chaban ()", "Aleksandr Bashirov ()", "Nikita Kukushkin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
