In order to pay the troops Wellesley needs a money draft from the banker Rothschild, but fears he has been captured by the French and sends Sharpe behind enemy lines to find him. Sharpe is given command of a platoon of crack riflemen, led by the surly Irishman Harper and including Hagman and Harris, who resent Sharpe as not being a 'proper officer'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2bbGfRNq7LfgKezBzFqUl52m0qf.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Bean (Richard Sharpe)", "Brian Cox (Major Michael Hogan)", "Daragh O'Malley (Patrick Harper)", "Assumpta Serna (Comandante Teresa Moreno)", "David Troughton (Sir Arthur Wellesley)", "John Tams (Hagman)", "Jason Salkey (Harris)", "Michael Mears (Cooper)", "Julian Fellowes (Major Dunnett)", "Lyndon Davies (Perkins)", "Sim\u00f3n Andreu (Major Vivar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [69787, 75133, 75134, 74405], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
