So we headed to the mall soon as the clock struck six.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned in my blog entry \u201cSheBlogger as a Reviewer of the Macabre\u201d (would be good to read that first before reading this review), I\u2019m always in the lookout for horror movies.  I especially watch out for Filipino horror movies because I\u2019m hoping for some improvements (and I have seen a few already) in this genre.  So when I first saw this movie on Facebook, I thought to myself, \u201cWow! Another promising horror movie, not long after The Healing\u201d.  Its Facebook page did not say much about the movie so I did not what exactly it is all about. I guess it\u2019s a marketing strategy to surround it with mystery.  Even the poster didn\u2019t reveal much, but did suggest a lot of things to the imagination.\r\n\r\nI will not go into details of the story because I don\u2019t want to spoil it for those who haven\u2019t seen it yet.  And the power of the movie is in the intricacy of the story.  I don\u2019t do to others what I don\u2019t want others do unto me.  I hate it when people purposely tell me the story of a movie I\u2019m planning to see.  I would just tell you what I liked and did not like about the movie.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE on:  http://heblogs-sheblogs.com/2012/08/amorosa-the-revenge-horror-movie-from-a-commoner%E2%80%99s-view/"}], "recommandations_id": []}
