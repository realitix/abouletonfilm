Featuring Snarky Puppy band-mates Michael League (electric and upright bass) and Robert Sput Searight (drums), with contributions from percussionist Felix Higgenbottom and a full string section and French horn.  This is a truly great contemporary jazz piano concert with nods to modal jazz icon Bill Evans, post-Coltrane piano giants McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock, and the fusion of Joe Zawinul & Chick Corea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/963WblME0HOR9jSvjfJdhKvouVh.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Laurance (Piano)", "Michael League (Bass)", "Robert 'Sput' Searight (Drums)", "Felix Higginbottom (Percussion)", "Vera Van Der Bie (Violin)", "Isabella Petersen (Viola)", "Annie Tangberg (Cello)", "Katie Christie (French Horn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
