There are more than a thousand of them. Until recently, wine was not only stored in the Kellergasse, but pressed and fermented there as well. Today, the Kellergassen have less to do with occupation and more with recreation. A documentary by Georg Riha follows a year in the life of this valuable cultural legacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5yng46farTZvMNj1i9f5tPmprDN.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Simonischek (Erz\u00e4hler (German version))", "Howard Nightingall (Narrator (English version)))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
