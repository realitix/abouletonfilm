Marley warns Scrooge he is doomed in the afterlife unless he pays heed and learns from three ghosts who will visit him during the night. The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come show Scrooge how his mean, uncaring behavior has oppressed those around him as they visit episodes from his past, his present and his future life. By the end Scrooge is humbled and redeemed and transforms into a generous, kind-hearted man.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iMxxQmIB9qu6qFvqlGMZ5mMyV3c.jpg", "actors": ["Bonnie Wright (Nell)", "Sarina Taylor (Bob Cratchett)", "Rebecca Hanssen (The Ghost of Christmas Past)", "Stuart Brennan (Scrooge)", "Seoras Wallace (Horseman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1RN1BiOn2Ro"}
