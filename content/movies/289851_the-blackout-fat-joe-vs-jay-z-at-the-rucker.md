Stephon Marbury, Ron Artest, Jermaine O\u2019Neal, Lamar Odom, Steve Francis, Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter, Kevin Durant, Jamal Crawford, and plenty of other NBA superstars have all laced their sneakers against equally respected street ballers to put on a showcase for the fans. This documentary covers the scheduled 2003 title match between Fat Joe\u2019s team, Terror Squad, and Jay-Z\u2019s team, Team S.Dot Carter. Things fell apart and the match never materialized.
