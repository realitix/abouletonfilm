The patrons of a late-19th Century America theater flock to see the latest production, a Western tale of redemption. Johnny Laredo, a middle-aged gunfighter fleeing his many enemies by traveling at night, stops briefly at the campfire of Tim Dawson's team of cattle drivers for a cup of coffee and a bit of human companionship. Dawson offers Laredo a job, but Laredo is afraid to return to Wyoming where he killed a number of men. Stopping in a small Texas town for supplies before heading across the Mexican border, the gunfighter is forced to fight a inexperienced youngster trying to make a reputation and kills him. Even though he is acquitted, the gunfighter has had enough and returns to Dawson, accepts the job, and hopefully, the opportunity for redemption.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johnny Cash (Johnny Laredo)", "Johnny Western (Marty)", "Merle Travis (Kentucky)", "Dickie Jones (Billy Joe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
