After doing time in hard-core Sing-Sing for petty thefts and drug dealing, Pi\u00f1ero's prison experiences developed into the 1974 Tony-nominated play Short Eyes. The resulting notoriety and fame was too much for the Latino bad-boy genius who retreated to the darker corners of New York City.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xBvdRm2WOr0OCZRVMAkPJDENMXx.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Bratt (Miguel Pi\u00f1ero)", "Giancarlo Esposito (Miguel Algarin)", "Talisa Soto (Sugar)", "Nelson Vasquez (Tito Goya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
