Utilizing footage shot by our cameras and video diaries kept throughout the year, we will show the world a new generation of courage in what could be the most homophobic place on a high school campus: the locker room. At a time where young gay men and women are literally being bullied to death, this film's poignant message is, there is hope. This film will bring to light stories of triumph and tragedy when young people are forced to follow their passion for sports with the handicap of social stigma dogging their every step.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u3YjoxWvRAjsQn7fzxj8mmLFalE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
