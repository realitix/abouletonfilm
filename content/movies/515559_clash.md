This film - part parody, part candid interview - is a response to Humphrey Jennings' 1942 'LISTEN TO BRITAIN', a documentary used to propel a myth of national unity.  CLASH, through the perspectives of underrepresented queer people of colour, critiques the myths we still tell ourselves on screen. Through candid interviews and staged period-drama sequences with our subjects - involving a hobby horse race in East London - our film explores the issues surrounding nostalgic heritage cinema, and how it erases the diverse landscape of Britain today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4cqNU8SWwmLCUzF06EvAAXuBlsY.jpg", "actors": ["Tim McInnerny (Narrator)", "Umber Ghauri ()", "Nadine Davis ()", "Tia Simon-Campbell ()", "Basi Akpabio ()", "Temi Wilkey ()", "Travis Alabanza ()", "Ijeoma Uzoukwu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
