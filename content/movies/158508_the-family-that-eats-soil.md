Her birthday fast approaching, the baby wishes that for once her family could have a normal meal as her big sister has group sex on camera while pining for their wholesome next-door neighbor. Meanwhile, their gangster big brother commits a heinous act of murder before seeing his best friend killed and being pursued by the police; dad injects hospital children with experimental chemicals; mom peddles drugs and hookers on a seedy cable television show; and grandpa is a zombie. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4OzyfNYdMTMeN1vRJY2Z6EBgQG.jpg", "actors": ["Carlo Catap (Lolo / Gramps)", "Hamid Eton (Erpat / Pop)", "Elizabeth Marin (Ermat / Mom)", "Gil Mendoza (Kuya / Bro)", "Hazel Magno (Ate / Sis)", "Edward Vitto (Bunso / Baby)", "Gigi Duque (Madame President)", "Christian Guzman (Doctor & Blue Flag)", "Jocelyn Sibayan (Nurse & Red Flag)", "Khavn (Dead Man on TV)", "Flortecante Dayao (Hospital Kid)", "Ariel Mamburan (Hospital Kid)", "Jaymar Valenciano (Hospital Kid)", "Cris Villanueva (hospital kid)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
