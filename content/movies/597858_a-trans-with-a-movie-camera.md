This was then documented on super 8 film. By combining this with other recordings of events and spaces within the trans feminine community, I've made a short, 14 minute, cine-essay examining the material I've collected. It's with the use of classical montage, as well as other cinematic techniques, that the footage is transformed to create new spaces and ideas to explore within trans film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lWAZLTWtL4NCyrbEYaPIde3JBRz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
