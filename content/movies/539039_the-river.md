There are five sons. The oldest, Aslan, becomes the father\u2019s deputy in charge of all the work and delegating tasks to his younger brothers. Fair and humane, he sympathises with his siblings when they err, and accepts the father\u2019s blame for them. One day Aslan takes the children to the river, a moment of happiness as the river is deep enough for a real swim. Since then, life is different. The children become more diligent in their daily chores, while the river turns into the focus of their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/amwH1mBtGaGG8xfJkgRzgRGWPpP.jpg", "actors": ["Zhalgas Klanov (Aslan)", "Kuandyk Kystykbayev (Father)", "Eric Tazabekov (Kanat)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
