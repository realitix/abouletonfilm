Here he comes to swinging seventies' London, seeking a cure to his malady. Unfortunately he meets Dr. Jekyll who injects him with a serum that turns him into the lascivious killer Mr. Hyde.  In his top hat and black cloak, Hyde haunts the flesh pots of Soho, while two gorgeous women fight for possession of his wolfman soul...  Top grade Euro-horror and definitely the craziest werewolf film ever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4CFu0w4eIxEXig2ubiXI7PxytHn.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Naschy (Waldemar Daninsky / Wolfman / Mr. Hyde)", "Shirley Corrigan (Justine)", "Jack Taylor (Dr. Henry Jekyll)", "Mirta Miller (Sandra)", "Jos\u00e9 Marco (Imre Kosta)", "Luis Induni (Otvos)", "Barta Barri (Gyogyo, the inn-keeper)", "Luis Gaspar (Thurko, Otvos's thug)", "Elsa Zabala (Uswika Bathory)", "Lucy Tiller (Whore)", "Montserrat Juli\u00f3 (Agatha (uncredited))", "Marisol Delgado (Nurse / Victim (uncredited))", "Mar\u00eda Luisa Tovar (Streetwalker / Victim (uncredited))", "Heinrich Starhemberg (Party Guest (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
