That is the question that Guglielmo and Ferrando ask themselves in Mozart\u2019s comic opera Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte. To answer it, they put their fianc\u00e9es to the test by pretending to go off to war and a short time later returning in disguise with the aim of seducing each other\u2019s betrothed.  Fortunately, the Op\u00e8ra de Lausanne has no time for such moral grandstanding. This new staging of Cos\u00ec is Jean Liermier\u2019s second production for Lausanne after his My Fair Lady in 2015. Joshua Weilerstein, artistic director of the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne, pilots the orchestra through Mozart\u2019s colourful score with St\u00e9phanie Gu\u00e9rin (Dorabella), Robert Gleadow (Guglielmo), Valentina Nafornita (Fiordiligi), and Joel Prieto (Ferrando) in the roles of the tried and tested lovers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1PrfU7XzZVHWgyHJ6V8VYEy8Tjn.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Gleadow ()", "Joel Prieto ()", "Susana Cord\u00f3n ()", "Bruno de Simone ()", "Valentina Naforni\u0163\u0103 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
