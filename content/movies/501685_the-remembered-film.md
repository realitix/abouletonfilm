But something isn\u2019t quite right. Soviet troops, the Wehrmacht and American soldiers in Iraq seem to be co-existing in the same peaceful woods. They speak awkwardly about war memories that could never have been their own. And yet they know them by heart. A lighthearted film connecting imagination and storytelling to the reality of war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jE6kAVsZEqvQN90W1gIKwSrRZxb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
