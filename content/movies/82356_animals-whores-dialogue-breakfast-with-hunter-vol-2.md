Thompson at work writing, editing, and recounting the creation of classics like Hells Angels and Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas. Animals, whores &amp; dialogue were metaphors and an element Hunter almost always wove into his writing, and the words were emblazoned on his typewriter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4F1Qs6RWOPzBqvhPnRX6WznBnyf.jpg", "actors": ["Hunter S.
