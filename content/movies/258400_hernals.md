The material was then divided into phases of movement. In the montage each phase was doubled. The techniques used in this process vary. Also the sound was doubled, again using different techniques. Two realities, differently perceived according to the conditions of this film, were edited into one synthetic reality, where everything is repeated. This doubling up destroys the postulate: identity of copy and image.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1310viAqLH5I2cjBgfh8sFlXtWl.jpg", "actors": ["Valie Export ()", "Peter Weibel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
