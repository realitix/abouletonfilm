Laced with moments of both humor and melancholia, Tell Me Do You Miss Me earnestly exposes the underbelly of a touring rock band in their final days together. Supported sonically with Luna's dreamy catalog of indie-pop and visually with lush travelogue footage with adventurous stops in England, Japan, and Spain, Tell Me Do You Miss Me is an elegy for an era.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j2hQkxGNktgjH6iVHdmFZK8hr1n.jpg", "actors": ["Dean Wareham (Self)", "Sean Eden (Self)", "Britta Phillips (Self)", "Stan Demeski (Self)", "Justin Harwood (Self)", "Lee Wall (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
