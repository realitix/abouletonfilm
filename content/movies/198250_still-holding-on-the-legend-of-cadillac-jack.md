His wife (Lisa Hartman) works to apprehend justice while, on the inside, Jack uses his talents to inspire his fellow inmates.\r\n\r\nThe tone is a meshing of \u201cThe Onion Field\u201d (1979) and \u201cBrubaker\u201d (1980), but of course with a different story and less polished production values due to the TV budget. Nevertheless, the drama is compelling enough and even moving in the second half.\r\n\r\nI found both Clint and Lisa convincing and don\u2019t see where people say Clint\u2019s a lousy actor. He may not be Robert Redford, but he ain\u2019t bad. Yet he wasn\u2019t the best physical fit for Cadillac Jack since Clint is 5\u20199\u201d while the rodeo star was 6\u20192\u201d. Then again, the same thing was done with Joaquin Phoenix playing Johnny Cash in \u201cWalk the Line\u201d (2005) so I guess it\u2019s not a big deal.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes and was shot in northeast Texas (Farmersville, McKinney & Cleburne).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"}], "recommandations_id": []}
