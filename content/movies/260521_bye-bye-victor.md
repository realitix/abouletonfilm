Slightly-unkempt, tired, and frail, Philippe Lanctot moves into a rest home. The administrator says she wants him to be happy, but that seems far from his mind: he's waiting to die. Then, into his room, unannounced, rolls the voluble Victor Laprade, who draws out Philippe over the next few months. Victor gives Philippe the gift of experiencing the moment. In return, the well-heeled Philippe organises field trips to dinner and to a botanical garden, and, unknown to Victor, becomes the man's benefactor when Victor's children get stingy. The openly-gay Victor also pushes Philippe to acknowledge feelings he's always kept suppressed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/se3ITNU6Idr1tBy3UoIlGLV8fyb.jpg", "actors": ["Jacques Godin ()", "Jean-Louis Roux ()", "Julie Vincent ()", "Jean Besr\u00e9 ()", "Muriel Dutil ()", "Marthe Nadeau ()", "Huguette Oligny ()", "Juliette Huot ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
