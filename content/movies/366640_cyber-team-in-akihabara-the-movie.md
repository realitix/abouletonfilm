I had no interest in any of the characters nor their daily lives after about 30 minutes of this short hour long film the plot finally kicked in or so I thought but then everything seemed to get pretty much resolved with 15 minutes still remaining. The biggest downside to watching this is that I now have zero interest in seeing the anime series that came out a year earlier."}], "recommandations_id": []}
