As The Lights Go Down is essentially the Arena video without the theatrical sequences, although the live footage for many songs was edited differently. This version was first aired on the Cinemax cable television channel, and later on MTV and other music channels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/crDcLqGqaeAsV1oiwrf25zPmwy9.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Le Bon (Himself)", "John Taylor (Himself)", "Nick Rhodes (Himself)", "Andy Taylor (Himself)", "Roger Taylor (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
