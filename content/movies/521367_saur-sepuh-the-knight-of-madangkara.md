The kingdom is then ruled by Wikramawardhana, son-in-law of Hayamwuruk. To rival Majapahit, Bre Wirabhumi creates the Pamotan kingdom and looks for allies amongst other kingdoms. This creates confusion among the kingdoms friendly with Majapahit. Brama Kumbara (Fendy Pradana) from the Madangkara kingdom tries to settle the dispute. What happens instead is a misunderstanding that leads to the death of Brama\u2019s envoy. Even worst, the lover of the murderer, Lasmini (Murti Sari Dewi), takes revenge by kidnapping Brama\u2019s wife. The conflict then escalates into the Paregreg war between Majapahit and Pamotan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qKiwr9Y2Aq4VTxLQzcXqhug3gJW.jpg", "actors": ["Fendy Pradana (Brama Kumbara)", "Anneke Putri (Harnum)", "Elly Ermawati (Mantili)", "Murti Sari Dewi (Lasmini)", "Baron Hermanto ()", "Hengky Tornando (Gotawa)", "Chitra Dewi ()", "Sirjon De Gaut (Wikramawardhana)", "Harto Kawel (Bre Wirabhumi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
