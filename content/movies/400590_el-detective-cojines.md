I have noticed there are no other reviews for this movie so I have decided to write my own in order to generate some interest in this great, little-known Puerto Rican comedy. The plot summary is provided elsewhere on this page so I'll just say that \"El Detective Cojines\" delivers on its promise to be funny. Writer-Director Radam\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez has taken elements of the private eye novels by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett plus the Spanish classic \"Don Quixote\" and added ample doses of raunchy Caribbean style humor to the proceedings, concocting an irresistible laugh-fest that only prudish squares will not enjoy. Jaime Hamilton (star of the Puerto Rican cult classic, \"Celestino y el vampiro\") is perfect in the title role of the dedicated but hopelessly incompetent private eye, and receives great support from the late, great Argentinian actor Axel Anderson as an old codger trying to find his missing inamorata, Ivonne Caro as a mystery woman with one specific sexual hang-up and Ren\u00e9 Monclova as a feisty real estate agent who becomes a sort of \"Sancho Panza\" for the title character. Director Sanchez skillfully weaves three story strands into one and drives it home with a hilarious slapstick climax.\r\nCheck out \"El Detective Cojines\". You'll be glad you did."}], "recommandations_id": []}
