The king of comedy is back with his most outrageous show yet! Filmed live at Jim\u2019s court, Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, in front of his faithful squires, and their ladies. King Jim gives the crowd what they want with a show filled with tales of wanton women, pointless wars and her Majesty\u2019s troops. All rise and salute King Jim and let him show you his world (if he had his way!)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qMUDE6Kdyec9cjqRqCvt3Jf6G0K.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Davidson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3BJd3LS-Dkc"}
