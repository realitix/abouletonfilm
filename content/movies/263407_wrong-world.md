Trueman does go, but after he arrives he encounters enough corruption and oppression to drive him out of there -- and into drugs. He decides to travel around the U.S., at a loss with himself and society, and eventually he meets Mary (Jo Kennedy), a young heroin addict who shares his angst about life. As the two commiserate, their bleak outlook lightens up a little, promising some fairer weather in the future. Jo Kennedy received a \"Best Actress\" Silver Bear award at the 1985 Berlin Film Festival for her portrayal of Mary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6xo5oCtKyDipWL87bgXgrerrTCE.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Moir (David Trueman)", "Jo Kennedy (Mary)", "Nick Lathouris (Rangott)", "Robbie McGregor (Robert)", "Esben Storm (Lawrence)", "Tim Robertson (Psychiatrist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
