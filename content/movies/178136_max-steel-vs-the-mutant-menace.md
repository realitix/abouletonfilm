This new boss is a freak control with an aggressive and all-for-the-team attitude which contrasts with Max's free spirit, causing several conflicts among them. In response to an emergency call, Max and Cytro are sent to an Antarctican subterranean lab which is also a prison for an unstable N-Tek agent who suffers some kind of mutation due to heavy exposure to chemical contamination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4KOHvz2yzgBPESn3WBHiQuQVyh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46844], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
