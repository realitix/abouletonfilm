In the vein of recent alternative horror/comedies like \"Machete\" and \"Hobo with a Shotgun\", HOLY HELL is a modern take on 60's and 70's B-Movie and Exploitation film tropes. The goal of this feature length movie is to break through every limit set by film, taste and reasonable societal behavior: all with anarchic glee.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r0cWZCxP1Eo0GAx1YoZcFnTo8jw.jpg", "actors": ["Ryan LaPlante (Father Augustus Bane)", "Alyssa King (Amy Bonner)", "Luke LaPlante (Officer Blank)", "Shane Patrick McClurg (Sissy MacFarlane)", "Rachel Ann Little (Trisha MacFarlane)", "Reece Presley (Buddy MacFarlane)", "Austin Schaefer (El Diablo)", "Michael Rawley (Dokes MacFarlane)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
