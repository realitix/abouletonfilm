Following the death of one of the tribe, the law soon intervenes and the prosecuting attorney, a Christian fundamentalist, scapegoats their leader and her group as a satanic suicide cult. The fundamentalist attorney pays a mole, an unemployed actor posing as a detective, to infiltrate the cult and bring its demise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7xGfp2SYHCqjgFhCUPnM0AokkKN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
