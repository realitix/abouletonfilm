Charlie passes himself off as the team's star but Bessie insists he was only good at being their \"water boy\". Charlie, determined to prove Bessie wrong, attempts to show Junior a thing or two about the game. But Bessie was right; Charlie isn't the most experienced athlete. He dresses as a tackling dummy which leads to disaster. He also gets the football caught in his mouth several times. Finally, he attempts to kick a field goal but the football has been set up a little too close to a water spigot and Charlie kicks the latter instead!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tW7tONDCViXwBlGcxcWB8k4cACl.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Frees (Charlie Beary / Junior Beary (voice))", "Grace Stafford (Bessie Beary (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pWUsKOmVTDM"}
