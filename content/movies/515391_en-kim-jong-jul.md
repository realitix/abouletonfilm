Luckily for him, he has an emergency plan. He sends the Norwegian department of the North-Korean mafia out on a mission to steal Christmas presents in the richest country on earth. After several successful break-ins, the mafia has acquired a big stash of presents. Little do they know that the Police Security Service is onto them, and do not intend to let the dictatorship get away with it so easily. They send their best agent to take care of business, steal back the presents, and save Christmas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/me4Zl1r1mXJxeUkHQZSSszHmEIq.jpg", "actors": ["Markus Lysgaard (Mons Multe)", "Peter Nes (Mr. Lee)", "Simen Westgaard (PST-director)", "Erlend Husbyn (Mafia #1)", "Sophia Nguyen (Mafia #2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oYdgkRQJdRI"}
