It infuriated me, because I had attempted to get away from his camera all my childhood. My father, filmmaker Joschy Scheidegger, documented our family obsessively. It was only when he died that I was impelled to take over not only his extensive film archive, but also his camera. \u00abMy Life as a Film\u00bb is a personal search for the surprising truths hidden behind my father\u2019s pictures. A philosophical family story about filming and the attempt to capture life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c9DQeGGZZgc6CMgCb5cQTlEafns.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6HQDa_VKDN8"}
