{"tmdb_id": 223841, "title": "Melancholia", "original_title": "Melancholia", "slug_title": "melancholia", "date": "1989-05-19", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Art critic Krabb\u00e9, a German ex-pat living in London, is confronted by his radical 1960s past when he's asked to assassinate a Chilean murderer who is on a visit to London. Krabb\u00e9's anti-hero is spot on and his increasing struggle with his identity convincing. Engel's intelligent and visually engaging thriller breaks a few rules while still relishing the dynamics of the mystery genre. While the feel of Melancholia is generally downbeat, such a fresh and intelligent thriller is certainly something to celebrate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3SbMGjWN4XFxnWiShzWmDkHt7ix.jpg", "actors": ["Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 (David Keller)", "Susannah York (Catherine Lanham Franck)", "Ulrich Wildgruber (Manfred)", "Jane Gurnett (Sarah Yelin)", "Kate Hardie (Rachel Lanham Franck)", "Saul Reichlin (Dr. Adolfo Vargas)", "Detlef Berthelsen (Dr. Berger)", "Mouchette Van Helsdingen (Receptionist)", "John Joyce (Butcher)", "John Sparkes (Roger Dere)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
