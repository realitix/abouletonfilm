Unaware of the mansion's reputation, Mason and his wife Mullen move in and hire a young woman, Lockwood, to keep house. Soon after Lockwood's arrival, strange things begin to happen in the household, and it becomes apparent that she is possessed by the spirit of the dead girl, though Mason scoffs at the idea. On death's door and bedridden, Lockwood asks for the same doctor who treated the woman who died 40 years ago. He arrives and treats her. The next morning Lockwood is cured, and it is revealed by the police that the doctor's dead body was found in his carriage hours before the time Mason claims he arrived to see Lockwood. Convinced that not only the ghost of the girl but that of the doctor as well entered his home, Mason finally believes in the supernatural.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hf0baGBi1TIbQBtIC6kPUqMuCE7.jpg", "actors": ["Jozie Lu (Casey)", "Tang Zhen Gang (Xiao Gang)", "Lu Yi-Ching (Yue)", "Jack Kao (Master Lin)", "Mok Chi-Yee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
