About \u2018Seeing\u2019: \u201cFilmmaker Matsumoto Toshio, a pioneer of experimental film in Japan and an advocate of Neo-Documentarism since the 1960s, conceived and structured this omnibus film, directed by six experimental filmmakers. Based on the theme of \u2018seeing\u2019, proposed by Matsumoto, the six directors approach the subject from varying individual perspective and develop their own unique images. The film addresses fundamental questions: What does it mean to \u2018see\u2019 things, and What does it mean to \u2018make films\u2019?\u201d  (from the official catalog of Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival 2009)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fxP3zkpeqt5ykKrnjhJ52Vzm5WN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
