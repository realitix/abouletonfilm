Invited to Dublin to present the premiere of a new choral work, The Messiah, he can't find singers adequate for the job. A boy who steals a chicken runs into Mr. Handel. The boy's Mother was NOT an employee at the Cathedral, she cleaned and ironed shirts, so the mother \"bribes\" Mr. Handel with non-starched shirts to save her boy from being in jail. The choir sucks until the washer lady's son is discovered by Handel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mRbSMh9H8H5OJo27dxLk7lz9vMj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
