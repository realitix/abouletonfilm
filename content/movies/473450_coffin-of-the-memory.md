Christian Ghazi resumes his cinematographic work with the documentary \"Coffin of the Memory\". The film mixes newly shot interviews with archive images. In the interviews it sheds light on two basic issues, solitude and economic situation. Through images and simple daily situations, Christian Ghazi draws a portrait of the Lebanese society, a society drowning in its contradictions and its search for an empty individualism and the superficiality of daily consumption, that of production, ideas, time and space.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sTO7hDupFEcdYXGPQIjRrUHNzEy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
