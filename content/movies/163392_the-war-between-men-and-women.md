Peter is a grouchy cartoonist/author whose vision is failing, divorced mother Theresa is also reluctant to plunge into a relationship right now. It's not love at first sight - both have their eyes dilated, plus Peter constantly lampoons women in his work, which book seller Theresa knows well. Loosely based on James Thurber's drawings \"The War Between Men &amp; Women,\" and Thurber's life, the film features animated sequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mjhA0QNdiDi5RIYqxImdq2Yq8xE.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Lemmon (Peter Edward Wilson)", "Barbara Harris (Theresa (\"Terry\") Alice Kozlenko)", "Jason Robards (Stephen Kozlenko)", "Herb Edelman (Howard Mann)", "Lisa Gerritsen (Linda Kozlenko)", "Lisa Eilbacher (Caroline Kozlenko)", "Moosie Drier (David Kozlenko)", "Severn Darden (Dr. Harris)", "Ruth McDevitt (Old Woman)", "Leoda Richards (Book party guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [545957, 304816, 473317, 470385], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
