{"tmdb_id": 312760, "title": "Uncle Walt", "original_title": "Uncle Walt", "slug_title": "uncle-walt", "date": "1964-01-01", "genre": ["Animation"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "The short begins with images of Walt Disney at various ages, followed by a slow pan across a graveyard full of the headstones of Perri the squirrel and her family (a reference to Disney's 1957 live-action fantasy Perri, [\u2026]). The next shot seen is that of a very early-style Mickey and Minnie Mouse, followed by racist caricatures and toilet humour. A sequence is then seen in which the female centaurs from Fantasia are seen working in a red light district, with Goofy as their pimp, followed by a scene in which various disturbing scenes from Disney films are shown, with a group of rabbit children looking on in horror [\u2026]. The final images seen are that of the seven dwarves from Snow White gathering around Mickey Mouse in a \"Mouse-ka-mausoleum\", worshiping him in a scene reminiscent of one seen in the original 1937 production.
