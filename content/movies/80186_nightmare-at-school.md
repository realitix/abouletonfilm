This is the central theme of this short animated film. Playing on imagination and humour, the director offers viewers a thought provoking piece dealing with the transition that young people between the ages of 10 and 13 experience. Inspired by the work of Escher and Magritte, Catherine Arcand has created a graphically rich film through optical illusions and trompe-l'oeil effects. Her style aptly illustra tes the theme of perceptions and is perfectly suited to conveying the dream world into which the film takes us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hoT4UjT8zQI46j6sYyN4ftqyf0V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
