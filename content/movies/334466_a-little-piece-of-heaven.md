Set within the walls of a Communist prison of the 1950s, a tale unfolds of a young couples' fragile love. An angry young man Lubos always felt defiance toward everything around him, and eventually this trait lands him in court. The verdict is clear and the punishment long and hard. But even in prison Lubos is unable to tame his love of jazz or the eternally blazing flame of rebellion he carries inside. There is no place on earth where love cannot grow. Lubos meets Dana in prison. Out of solidarity and support, their fellow prisoners hatch a small rebellion to help them fulfill their love - a love which has appeared in the wrong place at the wrong time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rEHiKem5o1sKT0pUmOXqtKnKGr2.jpg", "actors": ["Jakub Doubrava (Lubo\u0161)", "Tatiana Pauhofov\u00e1 (Dana)", "Zuzana Stiv\u00ednov\u00e1 (Dorota)", "Ond\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd (Rusn\u00e1k)", "Pavel Zedn\u00ed\u010dek (Roubal)", "Vladim\u00edr Javorsk\u00fd (\u0160ebek)", "Pavel Landovsk\u00fd (Starej)", "Petr Forman (Bruno)", "Karel Zima (Dr\u00e1b)", "Rudolf Pellar (B\u00e1sn\u00edk)", "Monika Zoubkov\u00e1 (soudn\u00ed zapisovatelka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
