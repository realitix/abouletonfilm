Though she wrote more than 2,500 poems during her lifetime -- verses that reveal singular talent and complexity -- Dickinson (1830-1886) chose to publish only seven, making her one of the most reclusive American writers of all time.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
