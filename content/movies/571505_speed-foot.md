Therefore, the people of the district will meet with L\u00fctf\u00fc, a new driver. L\u00fctf\u00fc who tries to get used to the district is in a contention with Sadenaz, who grows on the end of the bus every morning. Although the bus's departure time has already passed, this sympathetic girl runs on the bus like a storm, before L\u00fctf\u00fc's annoyance. However, in the course of time, a friendship between Sadenaz and L\u00fctf\u00fc is formed. L\u00fctf\u00fc does not move every morning before Sadenaz arrives.  One day, grace runs the timepiece to measure the speed of the Sadenaz. The speed of the Sadenaz corresponds to a speed that national athletes can run. The idea of \u200b\u200bbeing a runner for Sadenaz who loves running is interesting.
