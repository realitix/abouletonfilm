Daniel, Lina, Stefan and Therese are sixteen years old. They are the best of friends and are on their way out for the night. It is a night like any other and yet a night like no other before. When the sun rises, their lives will be forever changed. Daniel is in love with Lina, but Lina is hopelessly in love with herself and rock star Niklas Ravn. Therese is willing to offer Stefan her virginity, but Stefan would rather come out of the closet - to get closer to Daniel. But Daniel is much more interested in Therese.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZzWLUNAapQvYRsT6zH7MaUVmis.jpg", "actors": ["Dar Salim (Benny)", "Henning Valin Jakobsen (Stefans far)", "Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen (Niklas Ravns k\u00e6reste)", "Emma Sehested H\u00f8eg ()", "Gustav Hintze ()", "Victoria Carmen Sonne ()", "Anton Honik ()", "Laust Sonne ()", "Mette Frank ()", "Claus Gerving ()", "Emma Andersen ()", "Tara Andersen ()", "Roger Matthisen ()", "Zeino Macauley ()", "Donna Marie Thyrrestrup ()", "Pushpinder Dhanjal ()", "Anders Wallin ()", "Nils Gr\u00f8ndahl ()", "Jacob Funch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
