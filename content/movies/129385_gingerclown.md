Sam would do anything in order to get Jenny's attention, one of prettiest girls in school. Unfortunately she's also the girlfriend of the school's bully, Biff, the quarterback of the football team. Biff and his buddies are keen to take Sam to the old abandoned amusement park to make him prove his courage as part of their initiation ceremony. They involve Jenny in their cruel game as the grand prize of the competition. Sam accepts the challenge, but the girl wouldn't let him go in by himself; she follows him into the amusement park and a night they'll never forget.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rwe8bpvItr88A6wDtNaLFp8VPDt.jpg", "actors": ["Ashley Lloyd (Sam)", "Erin Hayes (Jenny)", "Tim Curry (Gingerclown)", "Sean Young (Nelly the Spiderwoman)", "Brad Dourif (Worm Creature)", "Lance Henriksen (Braineater)", "Michael Winslow (Stomachcrumble)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [24928, 114684, 91409, 39370], "youtube_key": "3YJt5WmXPW8"}
