Powerful and uncompromising, Killer's Paradise uncovers an emotionally wrenching human rights tragedy, while exposing an inept judicial system that allows it to happen. After almost four decades of civil war, Guatemala is a troubled society, but it can also be seen as a microcosm of the pervasive violence and injustice against women worldwide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bZeMRKHhN6JisXi0ltRsANjZdK5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
