Once in their more metropolitan junior high school, however, they are soon introduced to a wider and more exciting exposure to the world.  On the positive side, this includes independent ventures into the more culturally notorious elements of Tokyo such as Harajuku with slightly drunken upperclassmen (BOYS!!). Unfortunately it also involves being thoroughly initiated into their new school's rumored history of an omen-filled death three years prior on the school's rooftop and stories of hauntings by the ghost of a young girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AikE42G6PGukfpnkd8XZjXJEerp.jpg", "actors": ["Yuka Aoki (Miyuki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
