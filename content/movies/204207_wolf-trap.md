Set in the 1920s, the story revolves around an ambitious young provincial politician (Miroslav Dolozai) who enters into a marriage of convenience with a smotheringly possessive -- and much older -- woman (Jirina Sejbavola). Hoping to temporarily escape his overbearing wife's clutches, the husband strikes up a friendship with her young ward (Jana Brejchova). The relationship blossoms into a deep abiding love, but the jellyfish husband can't bring himself to declare his ardor to the girl. Even after the death of the wife, the husband hasn't the intestinal fortitude to admit his passion, and the results are bleak indeed for the unfortunate ward. Director Jiri Weiss does a masterful job staging his story of frustration and denial against a backdrop of post-WWI bourgeois banality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xjkErR57dnPYaCapnWDNE7qd4wN.jpg", "actors": ["Ji\u0159ina \u0160ejbalov\u00e1 ()", "Miroslav Dole\u017eal ()", "Jana Brejchov\u00e1 ()", "Jaroslav Pr\u016fcha ()", "Libi\u0161e Freslov\u00e1 ()", "Franti\u0161ek Holar ()", "Felix le Breux ()", "Bohu\u0161 Hradil ()", "Ane\u017eka Soukupov\u00e1 ()", "Lola Skrbkov\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
