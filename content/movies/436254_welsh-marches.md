The railway diverging from the South Wales Main Line at Newport closely follows the border through Abergavenny, Hereford, Shrewsbury and Nantwich. We join a 3-car class 175 Coradia DMU en route from Milford Haven to Manchester Piccadilly on the approach to Newport, the area having only recently been re-signalled to the South Wales Control Centre. From the SWCC, signalling passes to a 1960\u2019s panel signal box at Little Mill and then to traditional mechanical signalling at Abergavenny. Cameras inside all three signal boxes vividly show this technological progression.  Dozens of former and existing junctions coupled with some magnificent scenery make this a fascinating route, filmed in mid-summer sunshine all the way to Crewe. Dozens of mechanical signal boxes control our progress, including Europe\u2019s largest at Shrewsbury.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/spmh4ApYgsRgcZB3l1iTQ3PMglV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
