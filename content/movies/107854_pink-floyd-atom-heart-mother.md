This San Francisco audience is particularly quiet and attentive, a fact that seems to have facilitated a more intimate, unique and focused performance than other dates on this tour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Q2IjZz0F0BUDYRfT461PMfTiwk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
