They live a quiet routine life, each minding their separate jobs in the fishing industry. Ulrik misses the love and tenderness of a woman and arranges for the young, beautiful, Filipino Rosita to come to Denmark - just as many other men in the town have done before him. Johannes is reluctantly drawn into this as Ulrik's translator. However, over the following weeks Johannes and Rosita are getting more and more attracted to each other which forces Johannes to take responsibility for his dreams and his future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6NE04huUafjCQqzxEuW9St54Jw3.jpg", "actors": ["Jens Albinus (Ulrik)", "Mikkel Boe F\u00f8lsgaard (Johannes)", "Mercedes Cabral (Rosita)", "Julie Agnete Vang ()", "Mads Riisom ()", "Lise Baastrup ()", "Jacob Moth-Poulsen ()", "Anders Brink Madsen ()", "Girlie Lou Nielsen ()", "Marilou Nadonza ()", "Carsten Svendsen ()", "Niels Ellegaard ()", "Linda Fallentin ()", "Sara Bell Andersen ()", "Sara Bell Andersen ()", "Miss Maria ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
