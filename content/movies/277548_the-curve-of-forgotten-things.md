She inhabits an odd, timeless landscape that is both old and modern. She spends her days playing and collecting objects from history, things that she loves. She appears timeless. We follow her on a beautifully photographed, sun-drenched walk through oil fields. The mood is light and playful as she travels toward an old craftsman house on the property. Once inside the house mysterious events unfold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l8b4eUJh3tfY6dVzUngRgJUjzZE.jpg", "actors": ["Elle Fanning ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
