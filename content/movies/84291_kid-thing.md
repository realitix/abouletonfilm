Her father, a goat-farmer-cum-demolition-derby driver, does little parenting. Annie has no friends her age, so her daily routine is filled with solitary mischief. Playing in the woods one day, she hears a woman\u2019s plaintive call for help from an abandoned well. Though Annie feels driven to visit the well daily, she is unsure about how to deal with the woman\u2019s plight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g7KbMwBVGmM762XrqnwCxKNKZOj.jpg", "actors": ["Sydney Aguirre (Annie)", "Nathan Zellner (Marvin)", "David Wingo (Phone Mechanic)", "Zack Carlson (Convenience Store Clerk)", "Heather Kafka (Mom)", "Susan Tyrrell (Esther)", "David Zellner (Caleb)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85819, 174358, 32609], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
