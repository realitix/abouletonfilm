VESPUCCILAND is an exuberant and witty dance for the camera, shot in vivid, defiant color, records half a dozen spitfires (including Ross and fellow San Francisco experimental filmmaker Michael Rudnick) frolicking on a summer morn. Garbed in white costumes and ersatz hoods, the dancers embody the spirits of rebellion, solidarity, anarchy and free expression. Guaranteed to provoke a smile or three, and to evoke nostalgia for the trampled idealism of the 1970s. - Michael Fox", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/35k55jmJkraGM6k6D3zPdv0xeor.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
