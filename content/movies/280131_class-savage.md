In a world run by youth, primal attributes dictate who is 'King of the Classroom'. When Marty, a troubled but talented teenager, moves into the locker beside his school's 'Classroom King', a charismatic but grossly sadistic cocaine dealer, his position on the high school food chain sinks to an unsurpassed low. Marty is forced to make the decision of his life: put up with the savage humiliation, or respond with the same primal attitude he is attacked with. His choices slowly but surely reveal who is Class Savage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yneHTRi5sH88HbTc1ZSZeO7sVSK.jpg", "actors": ["Reece Thompson (Marty)", "Nolan Gerard Funk (Preppy Dealer)", "Kirsten Zien (Julye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
