The author's delivery is thoughtful, as if he is recounting the incident for the first time, and was filmed in 1949 for a series of short films sharing the title A Strange Experience. The story itself was unpublished in his lifetime.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Algernon Blackwood (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
