The Air Force has been in control of air traffic operations since the military takeover of General Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda in 1966. The producer/director, Enrique Pi\u00f1eyro, claims Argentina and Nigeria are the only countries whose air force controls and regulates the airline industry.  The film is heavily based on the Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Flight 2553 plane crash. Enrique Pi\u00f1eyro takes his camera, secretly, into the control tower of the Ministro Pistarini International Airport also-known-as Ezeiza, the international airport at Buenos Aires.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rLnz6rdfNmvxRTekmbLvjvdxVDA.jpg", "actors": ["Enrique Pi\u00f1eyro (\u00c9l mismo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
