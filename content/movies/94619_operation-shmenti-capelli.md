Karamfilov choose it as a metaphor for people with huge economic and political power. The funny comedy incorporates a tragic story in which Karamfilov plays two roles: the Big Guy and the Little Guy. Big is tied to the Mafia and the Secret services. Little is an unemployed teacher, squeezed and crushed by the system, which stops his heating and electricity, has his home emptied by a bailiff, and uses him as a tool in a game.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4E8uPaYw2cgcjfDzbNq3eFrADVr.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Anichkin (General Gospodinov)", "Zahary Baharov (Papa)", "Kiril Efremov (Botora)", "Malin Krastev (Nadezhdev)", "Kitodar Todorov (Verev)", "Vladimir Vladimirov (Person X)", "Plamen Peev (Totsev)", "Georgi Spasov (Bailiff)", "Dzheki Stoev (Shrink)", "Stefan Shterev (Gypsum)", "Ognyan Panov (Collaborator)", "Veselin Pavlon (Collaborator)", "Pavel Mitkov (Policeman Mitkov)", "Avgust Popov (Evlogi)", "Konstantin Slavchev (Shopa)", "Rositsa Litova (Kalina)", "Vladislav Karamfilov (Tseko Tsekov)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
