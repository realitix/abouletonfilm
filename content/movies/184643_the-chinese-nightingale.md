One day the Japanese send a music box with a mechanical bird; the nightingale feels rejected and leaves. Soon the clockwork breaks down, and the emperor dispatches his crow to go look for the songbird. The emperor, meanwhile, grows sicker with the passing months.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hgBLZJMyGaMhNaoBUoC9JNOiNY4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
