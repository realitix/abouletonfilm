The official position is almost 400 years old, and the job consists of sitting at a big desk, having lunch meetings with other governors, cutting ribbons at opening ceremonies, holding speeches and eating dinner with the King and Queen of Sweden. It is hard work, but someone has to do it. Bj\u00f6rck gives the viewer full access, making this personal portrait both humorous and very, very serious.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vAl2obalbNLp6X1nySFY9RI1eqG.jpg", "actors": ["Anders Bj\u00f6rck (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
