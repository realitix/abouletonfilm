Our protagonist is a housewife who has lost her family to the television set. Suddenly, her home is invaded and her life is taken over by characters that seem to spring from the V screen. Initially, she attempts to get the intruders out of her house. But eventually, she begins to see that perhaps a life on TV wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all. Will her distracted husband even notice her departure?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Tudi Wiggins (Mrs. Lavinia Smudge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
