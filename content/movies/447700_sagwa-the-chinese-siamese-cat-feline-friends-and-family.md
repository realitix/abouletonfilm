Sagwa is a small cat who learns some very big lessons about friendship as he is rescued by Fu-Fu, the bat, and plays hide-and-seek with the mice. Sagwa's big brother, Dongwa, learns the lessons of being too easily impressed and the value of just being who you are. Sagwa also learns how exciting family history can be when he discovers that the Miao family's ancestors were royal cats, learns the power of art through the magical story of his ancestor, the artist Ming Miao, and the folly of the Foolish Magistrate who nearly gave away a member of the Miao family", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xj3EknRtiYV7a0BFmVAXt4CCohw.jpg", "actors": ["Holly Gauthier-Frankel (Sagwa Miao)", "Oliver Grainger (Dongwa Miao)", "Jesse Vinet (Sheegwa Miao)", "Arthur Holden (Wim Baba Bao-Bao Miao)", "Ellen David (Mama Shao Fun Miao)", "Hiro Kanagawa (Shan-Tai-Yeh the Foolish Magistrate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
