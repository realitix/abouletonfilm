In my opinion a brilliant come-back for Howerd, with a new cast, and funny script. This could have seen a good return as a series on ITV, although Howerds own death in 1992 limited this. The cast in this one-off feature some regulars from other sitcoms from the 1970's including Roy Evans who now stars in Eastenders. The set was more like a theatre than a TV set, no reality at all which, was actually quite a good move. In summing up they successfully bought a true classic back to life with Further Up Pompeii. It's well worth watching at least 2.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/doxvUxUvSuPjAdC86HUPYCrxHPn.jpg", "actors": ["Frankie Howerd ()", "Joanna Dickens ()", "Elizabeth Anson ()", "John Bardon ()", "Russell Gold ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
