Included in the brilliantly restored and re-mastered animated triumphs in this eminently looney assortment of favorite  Bugs Bunny shorts: Bugs and Duffy's epic argument about which of them is fair game in RABBIT SEASONING; the outrageous operatic antics of THE RABBIT OF SEVILLE, and Bugs running rings around a bad-tempered bovine in BULLY FOR BUGS. And that's just the beginning...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zmzDBFOpyJAZHwxRBIVzDtJjY0d.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Bugs Bunny / Elmer Fudd (archive footage))"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "themovieguru", "content": "A wonderful selection of cartoons, beautifully restored and presented in an excellent package. Hopefully Warner Bros. will eventually present all of their cartoons on DVD, especially _What's Opera Doc?_ which is a personal favourite and notable by its absence from this disc. Still, a MUST buy!\r\n\r\nThe video quality is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe audio quality is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe extras are pretty good too, though not ideal."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
