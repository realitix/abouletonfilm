Hopefully Warner Bros. will eventually present all of their cartoons on DVD, especially _What's Opera Doc?_ which is a personal favourite and notable by its absence from this disc. Still, a MUST buy!\r\n\r\nThe video quality is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe audio quality is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe extras are pretty good too, though not ideal."}], "recommandations_id": []}
