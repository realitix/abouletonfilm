Stored in a permafrost deep-freeze for years, these remains are in pristine condition and represent an unprecedented window into the life of the Pleistocene Epoch. John finds a passion for bones and for collecting, assembling over a hundred thousand specimens from his mine site, \u201cThe Boneyard,\" and invites a team of expert paleontologists to study the collection. As the scientists wade into the mud, and peruse the boxes of the collection, discoveries are made that could potentially re-write the history of North America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mDgS7hZxZp1ccY4wDiEby0F39Q3.jpg", "actors": ["John Reeves (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "euJmNI4wftE"}
