This is the first live album released by Ira!, one of Brazil's most popular rock bands. The 20-track repertoire is generous in its extensiveness, and the band sounds inspired. The bulk of the material here is drawn from Ira!'s first two albums. From their debut, De Mudan\u00e7a, which is now considered a landmark within Brazilian rock, there is the punk song \"Cora\u00e7ao\" along with others such as \"Tolices\" (here with a folk music arrangement), \"Longe de Tudo,\" \"Como Os Ponteiros de Um Rel\u00f3gio,\" and a very fine version of \"N\u00facleo Base.\" From the group's second album, Vivendo e Nao Aprendendo, there is the excellent \"Dias de Luta\" as well as \"Envelhe\u00e7o Na Cidade,\" \"Vitrine Viva,\" \"Pobre Paulista,\" and \"Gritos Na Multidao.\" The band's sweet breakthrough hit, \"Flores Em Voc\u00ea,\" which at the time made it to the soundtrack of a popular TV series in Brazil, is of course also performed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v6gzz2OT5cABMtibqo1QMj4VfUe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
