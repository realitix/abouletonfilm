Structured around the ten most significant celestial bodies of the Milky Way, Apple Pie\u2019s inquiry begins with the furthest point in our solar system, Pluto, as a lens back towards our home planet and the \u2018mechanisms by which certain aspects of scientific knowledge are digested, appropriated and subsequently manifest within the general human complex\u2019. Christopher Francis Schiel\u2019s dry, functional narration brings a network of ideas about our existence into focus, while Hamilton\u2019s visual tableaux, as an extension of his multifaceted practice, veer imaginatively between psychedelic imagery and performance art.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8xWBqYAIv3KNpZ6fjM1pReqRh1i.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fhF9LTRA1js"}
