Whatever those expectations were though, I can tell you right now, they weren't met. _Winchester_ was massively disappointing, as by-the-numbers as you can get, and if it wasn't for a couple of good performances and the occasional decent effect, it would have literally nothing to offer.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [406563, 371608, 493922, 439079], "youtube_key": "0Juc2cL26mg"}
