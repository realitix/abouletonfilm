Of American Indian ancestry, but adopted by white foster parents as young children, each sister has her own identity issues and each has chosen a very different career path. Now dedicated to starting a Native cosmetic business, they attempt to overcome obstacles both in the business world and in the home. A touching love story of family and culture, Naturally Native also interweaves a subtle, but strong wake-up call regarding the treatment of Native people in corporate America. Naturally Native also provides some insight into tribal infrastructure and gaming issues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/esEkysmPlqZw4vtwZ4wWQ7o2EIy.jpg", "actors": ["Valerie Red-Horse (Vickie Lewis Bighawk)", "Yvonne Russo (Joanne Chapa)", "Irene Bedard (Tanya Lewis)", "Kimberly Guerrero (Karen Lewis)", "Pato Hoffmann (Steve Bighawk)", "Mark Abbott (Mark)", "Collin Bernsen (Craig)", "Mary Kay Place (Madame Celeste)", "Carol Potter (Rape Counselor)", "Floyd Red Crow Westerman (Chairman Pico)", "Max Gail (Mr. Carson)", "Jerry Rector (Policeman)", "Akima Castaneda ()", "Kevin Cloud Brechner (Extra)", "Lowell Raven (Vickie Lewis Bighawk's son)", "Courtney Red-Horse Mohl (Vickie Lewis Bighawk's Daughter)", "Robert J.
