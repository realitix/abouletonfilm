This was the first of four small-scale club shows that the band held on the European leg of their big-scale 1994/1995 'Voodo Lounge' world tour. These shows can be seen as a kind of response to 'MTV Unplugged' with the band playing rawer, stripped-down and sometimes unplugged versions of their well-known hits as well as rare songs. The Paradiso set list includes a number of rarities from the Rolling Stones' extensive back catalogue that are performed only seldom, including \"It's All Over Now,\" \"The Spider and the Fly,\" \"Shine a Light\" and \"Respectable.\" The final song from this show, \"Street Fighting Man,\" was used as the opening track on the band's 1995 album 'Stripped.' The full concert was released on DVD and SD Blu-ray as part of the 'Totally Stripped' deluxe boxed set on June 3, 2016.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/echs4EBB7BPasgUYbocyv0MLYK1.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Jagger (Himself (Vocals, Guitar))", "Keith Richards (Himself (Guitar, Vocals))", "Ronnie Wood (Himself (Guitar, Backing Vocals))", "Charlie Watts (Himself (Drums))", "Darryl Jones (Himself (Bass))", "Lisa Fischer (Herself (Backing Vocals))", "Bernard Fowler (Himself (Backing Vocals))", "Chuck Leavell (Himself (Keyboards))", "Bobby Keys (Himself (Saxophone))", "Andy Snitzer (Himself (Saxophone))", "Kent Smith (Himself (Trumpet))", "Michael Davis (Himself (Trombone))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TS1YUhPZAxI"}
