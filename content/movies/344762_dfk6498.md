Aged only 16, Duncan had already showcased his filmmaking talents on a series of award-winning short pieces made for Fair Go's annual programme devoted to commercials. With DFK6498, he channels his recent experiences into a short, stylishly-shot memoir of incarceration, frustration and freedom lost. The film went on to win a trio of awards at Wanganui's River City Film Festival and win praise from director Peter Jackson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zep33mELXz8flJDXTyjFTAIrDJk.jpg", "actors": ["Cameron Duncan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [86731], "youtube_key": "FBlgSeYktB8"}
