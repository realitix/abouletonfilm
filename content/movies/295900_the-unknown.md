Suddenly, they stop near a lake, in the middle of the woods, where the man decides to have a swim. He asks the two women for a drink. The women plan to assassinate him by introducing a deadly leaf from a Thanatos tree in the cocktail. The man dies by poisoning and drowning and the women stare at him without moving. They put the dead body in the trunk of the fancy car. Later, they've lost their way in the countryside and, finally, find a mansion where an old blind man, Colas, opens the door. Upstairs, a strange inventor, Tone Hobart, built a time machine which could resurrect the dead. Unfortunately, Andr\u00e9 is now alive and ready for a revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6voCWb7N6kchRUz8MWnL95Ylquq.jpg", "actors": ["Vera Miles (Kassia Paine)", "Barbara Rush (Leonora Edmond)", "David McCallum (Tone Hobart)", "Cedric Hardwicke (Colas)", "Scott Marlowe (Andr\u00e9 Pavan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
