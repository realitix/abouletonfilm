They were called Graham Chapman , John Cleese, Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin and later both they and the series became known as Monty Python 's Flying Circus .  Today they are the best known British comedy group in the world, famous from Cathay to Kathmandu, from Sydney to Sidcup (except in Japan where the programme is called The Gay Boys' Dragon Show ... say no more).\r To commemorate their tenth anniversary a BBC team tracked them down in the deserts of Tunisia where they were filming their Life of Brian and almost persuaded them to examine the genesis, the genius and the gender of Monty Python.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ieI7pz0NJP0Uznz6QCmZkGNVBwE.jpg", "actors": ["Graham Chapman (Himself)", "John Cleese (Himself)", "Carol Cleveland (Herself)", "Terry Gilliam (Himself)", "Eric Idle (Himself)", "Terry Jones (Himself)", "Michael Palin (Himself)", "Spike Milligan (Himself)", "Iain Johnstone (Himself (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
