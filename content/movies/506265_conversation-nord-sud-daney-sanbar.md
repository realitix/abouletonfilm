Saddened by this observation, we wanted to offer him a frame, both real and cinematographic, in which he could renew a dialogue that was interrupted at that moment. The choice of his interlocutor was immediately obvious: Elias Sanbar, Palestinian, historian, director of the magazine \"Palestinian Studies\", collector of images: an exile who archives the memory of his people: press photographs, album of family, postcards, etc. For Sanbar, the image is a proof of his identity. Daney spent most of his life watching movies, but has always refused to keep still images. On both sides, there was a very strong desire to confront these two attitudes in the face of the image and to make it, in a way, a parable of the North-South relations.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
