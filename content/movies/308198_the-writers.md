They find some hope when the drug addled Gonzo Kapoor, the son of a famous B movie producer, hires them to write an art house film billed as \"Tarkovsky with orgies\" for his directorial debut. All seems well until Dulal meets Ruma, a beautiful photographer who makes him question his choice to sell out, and the two friends must choose between friendship, love and the chance of a big break. The film delves into the world of young migrant writers, their hopes and their ontological anxiety.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
