Landscape footage of the \u201cFive Dragons\u201d in the Yangtze Valley, the third-largest river in the world, a Unesco World Heritage site in the Chinese province of Ch\u00f3ngq\u00ecng, is coupled with views of the gigantic city of Ch\u00f3ngq\u00ecng, which resembles a juggernaut and dominates the valley.  The beekeeper Sh\u00e9 Zu\u014f B\u012bn performs a traditional rite of spring on one of the rocks. He allows queen bees to be placed on his body who then summon worker bees. By the end, Sh\u00e9 Zu\u014f B\u012bn\u2019s body is entirely covered by bees. In a kind of trance, he stands utterly still. The buzzing of bees dominates all. He trusts the bees completely, and for a moment they lose all that is dangerous, terrifying. They are a protective shield.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hCpVh1LNRMVH9lck09m14ZmwcZK.jpg", "actors": ["Zu\u014f B\u012bn Sh\u00e9 ()", "D\u014dng J\u00fa Y\u00e1ng ()", "S\u0101n Y\u00fan Y\u00e1ng ()", "H\u0101i B\u012bn W\u00e1ng ()", "L\u00ec F\u00e9ng ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
