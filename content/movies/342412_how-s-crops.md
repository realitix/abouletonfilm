He uses his ingenuity to uncover the mystery. Cubby and his girlfriend go underground and create a crop of synthetic vegetables in their underground cave-factory, then force them upward through the soil. An evil clothes-wearing opossum conspires to steal the entire load of vegetables in his pickup truck, but Cubby's worm friend tips them off. Cubby bombs the opossum with a pineapple, blowing him sky-high. Beans, peas, and other assorted objects take on lives and personalities of their own.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
