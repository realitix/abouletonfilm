So, get prepared, because in Xuxa G\u00eameas Xuxa faces the challenge of impersonating two characters, at the same time: The shrew, Elisabeth Dourado, and her twin sister, the sweet Mel Montiel. Also in the main cast, the singer Ivete Sangalo is Alice, the teacher and Mel's best friend. Produced by Diler Associados, directed by Jorge Fernando, and written by Patricya Travassos and Fl\u00e1vio de Souza, the comedy tells the story of two sisters separated during their childhood that unexpectedly meet again. On one side, Elisabeth, who was born with a silver spoon and her only concern is to inherit her father's graphic empire The Dourado. In the meantime, together with Alice, Mel struggles not to lose the company's sponsorship that maintains the \"As Estrelas do Amanh\u00e3\" school. She'd never guess that the owner, performed by Ary Fontoura, is also her father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ps02rwtAv5ZGzlBu8Sgi1YMZN6n.jpg", "actors": ["Xuxa Meneghel (Mel Montiel / Elisabeth Dourado)", "Maria Mariana Azevedo ()", "Marcelo Barros ()", "M\u00e1rcia Cabrita (Diana)", "Beto Carrero ()", "Eike Duarte ()", "Jorge Fernando ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [231531, 243463, 354305, 146538], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
