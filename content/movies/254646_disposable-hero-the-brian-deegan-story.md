No one in freestyle has had it as good and as bad as Brian Deegan. Brian has collected more X Games and Gravity Games medals than any other competitor. He's appeared on the cover of Racer X Illustrated, Transworld Motocross & FreeriderMX. Features of him have appeared in not only these motocross industry related magazines but in FHM, ESPN The Magazine, DUB and Rolling Stone. Yet at the same time, he's accumulated more X-Rays, Pins, Rods, Plates, Casts, Gashes, and screws than most freestyle motocross riders. To top it all off, he most recently lost a kidney and severely injured his spleen while filming for MTV's Viva La Bam. \"Disposable Hero motivates you to throw away your crutches and kick the weak in their ass, The Grim Reaper was at the door and Deegan did not answer.\" - Jerry Bernardo", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jlLXaxd25yVewmlUpIBNmdke3Zt.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Ackerman (Himself)", "Jerry Bernardo (Himself)", "Mike Cinqmars (Himself)", "Brian Deegan (Himself)", "Seth Enslow (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
