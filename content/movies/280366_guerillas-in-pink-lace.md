Five American showgirls wrangle a pass with the aid of a helpful U.S. Army colonel to leave on the same plane. Ironically, the transport crashes at sea. The gambler and the girls wind up on a Japanese held island. Initially, they stay out of sight from the enemy, but inevitably things change.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k19PfrM2wU1sv3XnSTn4uecwMjK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
