It is a story about a talented surgeon Markalns, who after a serious personal crisis, returns to his native town in order to start his life anew. The attention is concentrated on the inner world of Markalns, his feelings in this so important period of his life, when to endure and to proceed means to regain the lost sense of life and himself. His character and emotional world opens in a wide scale: in collisions with colleagues, patients, friends, himself. He is contradictory, but even in moments of low spirits, virile. A real warmth and balance of mind is brought in the life of the outwardly robust and clumsy surgeon by a shy small-town girl Irita, called Doggie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oGPLOLfs25bVbX58CnvH6Yeaaoq.jpg", "actors": ["Uldis P\u016bc\u012btis (Zigurds)", "L\u0101sma Kugr\u0113na (Irita)", "Uldis Dumpis (Bratkus)", "Imants Skrasti\u0146\u0161 (Ko\u013ca)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
