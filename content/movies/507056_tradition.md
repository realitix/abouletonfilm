Trying to be faithful to the old man\u2019s principles, Xiang finds himself unable to control his master\u2019s widow and daughter, who are led astray by the widow\u2019s worldly, greedy sister. At the same time, Xiang must ally with other triads to smuggle aid to the forces fighting the invading Japanese.
