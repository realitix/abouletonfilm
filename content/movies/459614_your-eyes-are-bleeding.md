While primarily aiming to satiating the bizarre proclivities of their unknown clients, the pair also conspired to link the unrelated shorts together with an obtuse story thread and reoccurring characters, all with the hopes of eventually cutting the footage together as a feature length anthology film. Unfortunately the project was never completed and the footage has languished in the vaults for nearly 20 years... until now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vCPkTEyN0vLYFox7ckj6y8Nyk9R.jpg", "actors": ["Tina Krause ()", "Erin Brown ((as Misty Mundae))", "William Hellfire ()", "Eddie Blade ()", "Joey Smack ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
