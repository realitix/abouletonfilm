Their mom Eva works night shift at a hotel. We get to follow them during one month. Linus and Vanja begin to realize that they are living in a universe of their own. And there is neither room for the mom or boy- and girlfriends. At first it is only the longing love in unspoken thoughts. But when thought gets into words they realize that they are each others perfect half. They are drawn closer to each other and finally can't resist the taboo temptation in each others bodies. At first they deny, lie and try to resist. It's about shame and guilt and forbidden feelings which leads to a point where everything is at stake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1KR7SjJsD9iPWNx2nHXDsqi7KtE.jpg", "actors": ["Lina Englund (Vanja)", "Chatarina Larsson (Eva)", "Daniel Larsson (Linus)", "Embla Hjulstr\u00f6m (Vanja as Child)", "Emil Sabel (Linus as Child)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
