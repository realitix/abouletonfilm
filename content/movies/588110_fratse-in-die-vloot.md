Two lunatic comedians playing as ship captains accidentally lands on a real ship huge comedy moments unfolds as these two don't know a thing about being on a ship. It is hilarious and they have a way to create trouble. This movie is hysterical you can do yourself a favor and watch this if you want a good laugh. Other movies like this and also with the duo. Alles Sal reg kom,dis lacker om Te lewe,heirs ons weer and Kom saam vanaand! All of these 10/10 movies!!!!!!!"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "aMheOmJlXuA"}
