There are wafts of street noise, and occasionally the curtain flutters. A dog is barking. Then, elegiac music sets in, a lavish string arrangement, joined by Billy Holidays love-torn, tragic voice. She is singing \u00abThe End of a Love Affair\u00bb, and the entire agony of the end of her life resonates in it. The man at the window has meanwhile sat down on his chair, and the sad insistence of the song portrays his emotions. Is there something like the ghost of a smile flitting over his face? \u00abAnd the smile on my face isnt really a smile at all\u00bb, Holiday sings, and in the end all that is proven is the manipulative power of the combination of image and sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hXZKG3f8rIdscMkV5d5YktkXJRh.jpg", "actors": ["Gustavo Sumpta ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
