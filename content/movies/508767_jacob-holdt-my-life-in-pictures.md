Now he is forced to seek out the truth about his adventurous destiny. Jacob's extreme yes philosophy threw him into arms on the great love of his life, the United States. Here the young priest's son walked from Ku Klux Klan and murderers to the blacks at the bottom of the American dream. Jacob's approach to life led him into the struggle to transform racism hatred into love between people. But what inner demons drove the vagabond from place to place? We see Jacob when he confronts the sins of the past and clears up. It is embarrassing when long forgotten secrets are revealed; it is intoxicating when old flames suddenly ignite in glowing passion; It's brutal when death reaps in the garden of love. Can the long threads of life be merged like the vagabond's own beard? This roadmovie is a tribute to 'American Pictures' and to the journey, the adventure, the wisdom and, not least, the love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2KbYOKIhkI04MfkvmqGo2Ug79DP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SgxvaFIP6Y4"}
