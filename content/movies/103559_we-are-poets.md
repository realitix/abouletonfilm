Brimming with ideas and yes, with excellent poetry, each member of Leeds Young Authors has much to tell us all about being young, and living here and now. An inspirational film, and ample proof if it were ever needed that words can indeed uplift and change lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jKja1MpPuZ6Yt4YDY7rpvpCiaP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
