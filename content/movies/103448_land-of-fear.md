Gradually, after years of losing grip over his mission and purpose, realising that being a drug dealer has become his true identity, and that he hasn't heard back once from his supervisors, he then goes and tries to contact them back, only to realise that the designated postman had never delivered back any of the reports to his supervisors, let alone is aware that they exist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/smlFCJnx6fI9NBnn165KARfopCn.jpg", "actors": ["Farah (Farida)", "Hamdy Gheith (Hodhod)", "Abdel Rahman Abou Zahra (Mousa)", "Ezzat Abou Aouf  (Omar Elassiouty)", "Kamal Ahmad (Ahmed)", "Zeina (Hanaa)", "Ahmad Zaki (Yehia)", "Fathy Abdel Wahab ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
