He takes advantage of a visit to his sick mother to look for Sue, but she refuses him. The persuasive rector reverses Soo-hyeon\u2019s decision to leave the seminary with a proposal that he undergo a catharsis in the monastery. The doubting youngster\u2019s new-found peace is lost however when he sees novice Helena, whose similarity to Sue awakens his defused emotions. The cool tonality of the shots of the Korean countryside and the monastery interiors harmonises perfectly with the aesthetically austere, nonetheless suggestive direction, which mediates the young man\u2019s internal conflict and his fear of making the most important decision of his life. The lead role is played by rising star of Korean film Seo Jang-won, whose acting debut in the film The Unforgiven was shown at last", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qyoiSP5rIoZqTbvmaZ5eyPMzlPC.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Min-jung (Sue, Helena)", "Seo Jang-won (Soo-Hyeon)", "Lee Ho-Young (Kang-Woo)", "Ki Joo-bong (Father Moon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3qS2p7Dsano"}
