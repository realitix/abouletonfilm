They braved heavy weather, flew on rickety prop planes, and ate seal meat en route to discovering one of the best cold-water slabs in the world. The film follows the cold-water crew as they traverse the island on quad bikes, tracking pulses of swell to remote bays and never before surfed points. Set against the stunning volcanic backdrop of the Aleutian Islands, The Cradle of Storms is cold-water surf exploration at its finest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pkTCZpS6zL1KlgadZ5tTsz1uKNa.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Devries (Himself)", "Alex W Gray (Himself)", "Josh Mulcoy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ppnYnpm0TNA"}
