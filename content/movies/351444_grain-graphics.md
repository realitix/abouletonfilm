In grainy negative, a small number of figures interact in various ways in each of the frames. Gradually, as if the camera were drawing away, this pattern grows smaller and its units increase correspondingly in number, until at the end there appear to be hundreds of rectangles, all with figures busy in motion.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAvYe704GtOqr3IHrfYcR04TW2U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
