Despite the United Nation\u2019s eventual intervention, most of Liberia\u2019s young people continue to live in abject poverty, surrounded by filth, drug addiction, and teenage prostitution. The former child soldiers who were forced into war have been left to fend for themselves, the murderous warlords who once led them in cannibalistic rampages have taken up as so-called community leaders, and new militias are lying in wait for the opportunity to reclaim their country from a government they rightly mistrust. America\u2019s one and only foray into African colonialism is keeping a very uneasy peace indeed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g9mUElsLbBNjgSfsqNWpV8sYvad.jpg", "actors": ["Shane Smith (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
