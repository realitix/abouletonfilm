Their destined mission becomes apparent when a handsome ninja from 400 years past drops from the sky into the hot tub of on of the girls. He comes with news of a grave threat: an evil industrialist has apparently joined forces with UFOs to take over Japan. The only solution, it seems, lies in the special talents of the three girls - notable as much for their martial arts as their skimpy costumes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pW7gWbOJSb4cw0mFeeyOXkAYIie.jpg", "actors": ["Yuka \u00d4nishi ()", "Minako Fujimoto ()", "Akemi \u014cshima ()", "Shimon Kumai ()", "Hideyo Amamoto ()", "Tessei Miyoshi ()", "Yoshikazu Ebisu ()", "Akihisa Mera ()", "Ichimasa Wakamatsu ()", "Chin Nait\u00f4 ()", "Sh\u00f4hei Yamamoto ()", "Michiru Jo ()", "H\u00f4sei Komatsu ()", "Tetsur\u014d Tamba ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
