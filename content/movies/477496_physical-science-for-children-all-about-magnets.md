They discover that opposites attract and likes repel, and how this concept is used to propel the unique \"Bullet Train,\"which is able to move at high speeds without touching the train tracks!  The program also explains magnetic fields and introduces electromagnets __ dramatically demonstrated by a scrapyard crane lifting tons of metal high in the air.  Also included is a fun activity that illustrates how kids can use a magnet to remove iron from fortified breakfast cereals.  This program is based on the concepts outlined in the National Science Education Standards for Physical Science.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
