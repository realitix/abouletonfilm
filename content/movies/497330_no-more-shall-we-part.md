A small cottage sits alone in the mountains, dwarfed by the surrounding landscape. It's inhabitants, a humble married couple who have been driven from their home country of Scotland during the Highland Clearances, have fallen on desperate times. Driven to the edge and in isolation, Henry, a man with an unshakable devotion to his wife and God, struggles to maintain routine in the face of sheer desperation, until an unexpected arrival threatens to shatter his world completely. No More Shall We Part examines the lengths that we will go to in order to preserve the love of another in the face of adversity, weaving a beautiful, brooding tale of one man's struggle against the wilderness and his own psyche.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v7pewNDquimpwuzFDXuhdhccG3q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
