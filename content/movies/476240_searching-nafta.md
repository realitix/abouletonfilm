In the fragments of conversations captured in the Maputo market, a recording studio and on coconut trees, we find daily routines and tedium lead to chit-chat on desire, money and hope. In the interplay between performance and document, poetry emerges from fleeting everyday moments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fBIsq8GPkqGUTsNHM2Qy35MfUrr.jpg", "actors": ["Zacarias Covela ()", "Domingos Marengula ()", "\u00c9dio Peleve ()", "Belton Guilade ()", "King Best ()", "Mim\u00f3rcia Nhantumbo ()", "Vivaldo Zandamela ()", "Helder Tinga ()", "Big John ()", "Carlos Hernandez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
