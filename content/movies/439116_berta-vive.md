Mexican activist Gustavo Castro, a witness to the crime, survived the horror of that night and was trapped in Honduras. The defense of the river Gualcarque, sacred to the Lenca people, against the installation of a hydroelectric plant, is the preamble of a story in which we follow Garifuna leader Miriam Miranda, friend and companion of Berta. Their struggle for decolonization is the same, in a country that is sold to transnational capital and takes lives in many ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4hWea2sFO37u8RL3st4GtFJQQcz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
