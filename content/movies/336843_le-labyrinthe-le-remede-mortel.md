As a member of _The Death Cure's_ audience I do genuinely appreciate that.\r\n\r\nI am less appreciative however of the movie itself. It doesn't at all pay off the confusion I suffered at the hands of the franchise. My opinion on the _Maze Runner_ series has been mixed, but I feel certain that this one is the worst, and not only that, but it kind of retroactively made me appreciate the first two less.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [294254, 198663, 338970, 262504]}
