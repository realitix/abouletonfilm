It\u2019s a story. The story stretches back to the ancient mountains of China, to the deep Canadian bush \u2014 from a parking lot big-air jump in Michigan to Norway\u2019s Arctic Circle. It\u2019s shouted from the top of Colorado\u2019s Rockies and around the rocky rim of Lake Tahoe. This is a story that\u2019s rewritten each winter, and one we\u2019ll never tire of telling. How else would our love of snow get passed down from generation to generation?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lpo2HirJuX4nfAVCwE0QguirdEr.jpg", "actors": ["Jonny Moseley (Narrator)", "Chris Anthony (himself)", "Austin Ross (himself)", "Chris Davenport (himself)", "Ingrid Backstrom (himself)", "Daron Rahlves (himself)", "Mike Wiegele (himself)", "Lexi Roland (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
