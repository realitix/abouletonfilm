A catalogue of extreme experiments with the mobility of the camera coordinated with brief improvisations by the Brazilian dancer Alice Bloch. It was mostly filmed with an Instamatic m22 camera (possibly the simplest and lightest Super 8 camera, with a fixed lens and manual diaphragm), so resistant that it functioned in conditions that would be unthinkable with a more complex camera, rotating at high speed around the optical axis or tied to a 35mm reel rewinder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tQBU7ZZuIRBu2R25TPEF3fn37FL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
