Footage from the stag film Smart Alec, a film given to me by my grandfather, is used as the majority of the source imagery, set to a rendition of \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d performed by Dallas based vocalist Lily Taylor. The song was noted by Candy Barr as her favorite to dance to, while also noting that she viewed her dancing as a form of creative expression. The silver-based emulsion of the film was replaced with cyanotype chemistry and laid under the sun to create the blue image.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
