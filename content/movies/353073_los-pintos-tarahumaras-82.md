Passion processions depict two kinds of \"fariseos\" (Pharisees): some dressed in white and crudely daubed with chalk; others, almost naked--feather helmets wearers--fully marked with large white spots. Children, teenagers, young men; all the men of the tribe are organized into a strip under the lead of an older flag carrying dancer. They occupy the site of the village for three days and three nights witn uninterrupted, obstinate drums. Commemoration or preparation for what fight? For the strange figure of Governador leather mask seems to revive the tradition of the leader of nomadic warriors. On Easter morning, the public festivities end abruptly with the appearance of two Pascoleros in body paint, the dual perform a subtle dance: they will be the signal for the up-to-death of Judas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ijmqtefYPuztnUkLJ7gESccBnTp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
