The film more properly belongs, however, to choreographer Frederick Ashmore, composer John Lanchbery, and costume designer Rostislav Douboujinsky. This literal adaptation concerns the shy Beatrix Potter and how, when all of the toy animals in her room come to life, she emerges from her shell and begins to enjoy life. Sequences include a rowdy dance with Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca destroying a collection of plaster food, a midnight pas de deux between Pigling Bland and Pigwig, and a corps de ballet of dancing mice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1sL2W2rWocPJaM139eYI8pspH89.jpg", "actors": ["Frederick Ashton (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle)", "Alexander Grant (Pigling Bland / Peter Rabbit)", "Julie Wood (Mrs. Tittlemouse)", "Ann Howard (Jemina Puddleduck)", "Bob Mead (Fox)", "Garry Grant (Alexander)", "Sally Ashby (Mrs. Pettitoes / Tabitha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
