In that time he has offered only glimpses into his creative process. Creative Domain is a rare in-depth documentation of how he creates a single dance. Through the lens of award-winning cinematographer Tom Hurwitz, we see Paul\u2019s non-verbal communication with his dancers. Below the surface of this dance and the many works that came before, is Paul\u2019s power of acute observation, revealing a side to his choreography that is strangely prophetic. The dominant voice is Paul\u2019s, between the guarded and unguarded moments we see him with new eyes and new understanding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kfHj7QSHojPcSGqcrxpWrinGQlv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
