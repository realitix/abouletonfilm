The fresh bloom of friendship that the new neighbor offers impacts the relative calm of their world. Yet, the Japanese woman - with an expiring visa - has her own demons to face. The story explores synchronicity and the fragile ties that bind us to certain people and certain junctures of our lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/homG7OYILaF5DbG46sVtRd85bew.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Black (Arthur)", "Deborah Duke (Willie-Mae)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
