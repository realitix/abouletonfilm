Actually, Wood does not appear much in this film. Rather, it centers on the lives and thoughts of his entourage and those who knew him. Among those interviewed are Wood's former lover and star of his earliest films, Dolores Fuller, whom he abruptly replaced in the middle of Bride of the Monster with actress Loretta King who is also interviewed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rarwGANB2L4EcxInVw1Q8TgcfU1.jpg", "actors": ["Maila Nurmi (Herself)", "Dolores Fuller (Herself)", "Paul Marco (Himself)", "Bela Lugosi (Himself (archive footage))", "Bela Lugosi Jr. (Himself)", "Loretta King (Herself)", "Lyle Talbot (Himself)", "Norma McCarty (Herself)", "Michael McCarthy (Himself)", "Conrad Brooks (Himself)", "Lynn Lemon (Himself)", "Mona McKinnon (Herself (voice))", "Gregory Walcott (Himself / Narrator)", "Edward D.
