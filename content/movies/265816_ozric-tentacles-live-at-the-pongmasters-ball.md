The DVD includes classics from Ozric Tentacles' vast back catalogue as well as previously unreleased material and the odd 'space-jam' where the band free themselves from the shackles of rehearsed material and let the music wander into unknown territory.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
