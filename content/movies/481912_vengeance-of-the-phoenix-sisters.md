At the same time, the much lower budget Taiwanese dialect films were tapping into the booming market of Southeast Asia. With its balletic choreography, expressive cinematography and kinetic editing, Vengeance of the Phoenix Sisters rivals the best Shaw Brothers swordplay films of the era. This tale of generational revenge features three of the Taiwanese dialect cinema\u2019s biggest names: opera superstars Yang Li-hua and Liu Ching as the eldest and second sisters, and the goddess of melodrama Chin Mei as the third sister.-UCLAFilm&TV", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ySG6hBlvfqFRyufLCY9klj8tAgd.jpg", "actors": ["Yang Li-hua ()", "Liu Ching ()", "Chin Mei ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
