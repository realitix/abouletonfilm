This DVD will show you how to use the 3 simple Motor Officer techniques the cops have been trained in for more than 60 years. Until now, these training secrets have not been available to the general public. I have developed a simple step by step procedure that will allow you to master the 3 Motor Officer techniques in just 3 to 4 hours. I know my step by step plan works because I've put hundreds of students through the exact course you'll see on this DVD. I use a modified version of the Police Motor Officer course that can be mastered in just 1 day. Even riders with 20 years of experience will improve their skills by 100%. I'll even show you the tricks to passing your State motorcycle endorsement test.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u38yKpgWx8rDzla80l2hon29az0.jpg", "actors": ["Jerry \"Motorman\" Palladino (Himself)", "Donna Palladino (Herself)", "Marianne Hamilton (Herself)", "Tim Hamilton (Himself)", "Rick Rutel (Himself)", "Joey Aleman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
