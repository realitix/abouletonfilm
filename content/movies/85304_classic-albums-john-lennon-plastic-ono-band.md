Yes, John Lennon's first post-Beatles solo album is still a must-own for any rock fan, but decades of punk, metal, and grunge have desensitized our ears somewhat to the naked howls of despair that fill tracks like \"Mother,\" \"Isolation,\" and \"I Found Out.\" In addition, \"I don't believe in Beatles,\" the climactic line of \"God,\" doesn't have nearly the resonance as it did around the time of the Fab Four's breakup, when such a sentiment practically bordered on heresy. And yet it's a testament to the high quality of Lennon's songs that Plastic Ono Band continues to be an incredibly moving listening experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w682GkZJFjJUaR3DK8A5KhkVabm.jpg", "actors": ["John Lennon ()", "Yoko Ono ()", "Klaus Voormann ()", "Ringo Starr ()", "Jann Wenner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
