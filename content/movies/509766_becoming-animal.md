'Becoming Animal' is an attempt to give some of these new ways of thinking a cinematic form. An essay based on a field trip to Wyoming's wild nature, in the company of the bio-philosopher David Abram and the two visionary filmmakers Emma Davie and Peter Mettler. And with an abundance of bison, moose and birds. Both form and thought are unchained in a film that ends up moving (far) beyond man's self-centred view of nature, and into a state of almost psychedelic receptiveness. hroughout his many years as a filmmaker, Mettler has dealt with abstract phenomena such as northern lights, ecstasy and time itself. With Davie as fellow filmmaker and Abram as a travelling companion, 'Becoming Animal' (named after Abram's landmark book) is a film that makes you see everything with slightly different eyes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9EB03mgvXt4tB1GvqDuQ9Qtp7uX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
