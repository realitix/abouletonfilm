Along the way, his car breaks down and a girl walking along the highway asks for a lift. It turns out she's a nice girl, named Perry, running away from a job at a gasoline station. Soon they're off to New York together, but part ways once they arrive. Time passes and Eddie is failing to sell his play; Perry is failing to find a job. Odd circumstances, involving an old pickpocket named Mandy, bring them together again.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Guy Madison (Eddie Tayloe)", "Diana Lynn (Perry Dunklin)", "James Dunn (Mike)", "Michael Chekhov (Gaboolian)", "Florence Bates (Mandy)", "Lionel Stander (Bellhop)", "William Frawley (Agent)", "Roscoe Karns (Officer Carmody)", "Margaret Hamilton (Ruby Cheever)", "Irene Ryan (Opal Cheever)", "Colin Campbell (MacWirther)", "Moyna MacGill (Pearl Cheever)", "Audie Murphy (Copy Boy)", "James Burke (Cop (uncredited))", "James Burke (Bartender (uncredited))", "Alvin Hammer (Bernie (uncredited))", "Dewey Robinson (Sergeant (uncredited))", "Mary Treen (Wife (uncredited))", "Jesse White (Customer (uncredited))", "Clem Bevans (Capt.
