The film is built on conversations between me (the director) and God (my psychotic mum), whose face we never see in the film. We talk about her worlds; We encounter her flower language, we meet the devil\u2019s birds and we learn how to marry the wind. The film turns into a declaration of love - to the crooked mind as well as to my mother.\" - Maria B\u00e4ck", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oQAKhGYUHoU1veSCZC6osRpxNWh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
