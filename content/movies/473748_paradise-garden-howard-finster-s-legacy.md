He took what others might deem trash or obsolete and turned it into something contemplative. He opened Paradise Garden for the world to enjoy, a true testament that Art comes to life, when people are able to interact with it. Howard Finster showed the world that objects surrounding us can take on a new life, in a sometimes magical way, and communicate messages that can lead to transformation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wtfJYcbEWft7D7eOR3hHoxagdOU.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Mills (Himself)", "Amy Ray (Herself)", "Chris Frantz (Himself)", "Howard Finster (Archival Footage)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
