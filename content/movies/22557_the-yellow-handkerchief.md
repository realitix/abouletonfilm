He\u2019s a young adult and he\u2019s single so naturally he uses his ride to ahem, look for companions. He offers a ride to a shy girl by the name of Akemi and she reluctantly accepts. From the get go, sexual tension is apparent, but things get a bit easier as the two become acquainted. They pick up Yusaku, a 30-something coal miner with a reserved personality. The story slowly begins to shift from the comedic hijinks of Kinya and Akemi to Yusaku\u2019s mental drama. He\u2019s hiding something about his past, which he either wants to forget or is trying to remember.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/stV0AxRP8kZhqdUWGv0Csdd0i6r.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Takakura (Yusaku Shima)", "Chieko Baish\u00f4 (Mitsue Shima)", "Kaori Momoi (Akemi Ogawa)", "Tetsuya Takeda (Kinya Hanada)", "Hachiro Tako ()", "Hisao Dazai (Ryokan Manager)", "Mari Okamoto (Ramen Shop Girl)", "Kiyoshi Atsumi (Watanabe Kacho)", "Akihiko Hany\u00fb ()", "Hidetoshi Hasegawa ()", "Kazuhiko Kasai ()", "Midori Kawai ()", "Yoshino Tani ()", "Sakae Umezu ()", "K\u00f4ei Yamamoto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [95164, 113249, 113878, 73324], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
