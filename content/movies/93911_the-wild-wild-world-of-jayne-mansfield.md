She takes us through Rome, shares a fantasy about Roman athletes, and then is off to Cannes. She takes a trip to the nudist colony on the Isle of Levant, where she almost kind of joins in. Then it's off to Paris, where she gets a beauty treatment from Fernand Aubrey, and attends some racy dance revues. In New York and Los Angeles, she visits some topless clubs and listens to a topless all-girl pop band. The film wraps up with some posthumous footage of her family in mourning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vICrGemUOrFyHXoM4Mj7qv6uDfG.jpg", "actors": ["Jayne Mansfield (Herself)", "Robert Jason (Narrator)", "Fernand Aubrey ()", "Monte Duro ()", "Lino Enner ()", "Brigitte Halberg ()", "Bob Oliver ()", "Rocky Roberts ()", "Lila Solh ()", "Carolyn De Fonseca ()", "Mickey Hargitay (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
