Starting in 1970s Hokkaido like a nervous Japanese Starsky &amp; Hutch\u2013\u200bchan, the film charts the moral descent of Detective Moroboshi (Go Ayano) over three decades. Green in years but already hard\u2010grained and ready to play rough, the young cop quickly gets a bit too cozy with the other side of the law when his senior colleague Murai (Pierre Taki) teaches him the ropes and ruts of the police business. Soon, he swaggers and rants through the streets of Sapporo a lean, mean, sex\u2010crazy bully, indistinguishable from a yakuza. Burning with the same blaze as the hard\u2010boiled  classics of yore, \u200bTwisted Justice scorches away the sleekness and macho self\u2010congratulation of the genre. \u200b", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/df0cYC8Yr75zs3Iz4A08pAyWdhh.jpg", "actors": ["Go Ayano (Morohoshi)", "Shidou Nakamura (Katsusuke Kuroiwa)", "Young Dais (Taro Yamanobe)", "Yukio Ueno (Rashido)", "Pierre Taki (Detective Sadao Murai)", "Munetaka Aoki (Detective Kenzi Kuribayashi)", "Haruna Yabuki (Yuki Tasato)", "Takuma Otoo (Hirokazu Kuniyoshi)", "Takayuki Kinoshita (Chikara Kagaya)", "Kumi Takiuchi (Toshiko Hirota)", "Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Tanaka (Takashi Saruwatari)", "Minosuke (Toshio Kishitani)", "Tomoya Nakamura (Ryota Kosaka)", "Katsuya (Takuma Urushibara)", "Ito Shiraishi (Taro Yamanobe\u2019s Girlfriend)", "Ayumu Sait\u00f4 (Yukio Sakuraba)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
