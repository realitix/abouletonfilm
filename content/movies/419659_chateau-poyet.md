The camera chases improbable incidents across the screen. Many are constructed out of one of Jordan's favorite engravings illustrators: Poyet. Duels occur on a tight rope. Heavier-than- air machines fly (and sometimes crash). Below guns spear exploding spheres. The timing of the animation is exquisite, existing in an atmosphere balanced between frenzy and delight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uItLi6Vx7w4cy9Jx4TvXwQ0dhDY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
