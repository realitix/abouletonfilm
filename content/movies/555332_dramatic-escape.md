Tracing the inmates' steps from auditions through their curtain call, we are witness to their journey - both as individuals and as a players ensemble. All of the obstacles involved with putting on a stage production on the outside become all the more difficult behind bars. Hear the inmates' stories and candid retelling of the crimes that landed them in prison. Witness their everyday struggle with what they have done and listen as they contemplate whether redemption is ever achievable either to themselves or to the outside world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6XFEgWncFnKuve0IJSEseAmdojx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
