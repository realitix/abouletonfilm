This film thus allows us to hear with pleasure words that break with cultural gossip, that question and throw light \u2013 a verb, a man that resist here and now. We learn a great deal from it, whether or not we are familiar with Straub-Huillet\u2019s work. Tell Me Something tells us a story, or stories. Stories about cinema, stories about faithfulness and honesty. The story, also, of the setting up of a people rising against ruling state of things. The story, moreover, of an irreparable absence \u2013 that of Dani\u00e8le Huillet. In short, the story of a filmmaker in winter, and of an international community that is enlightened in the darkness.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jean-Marie Straub ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
