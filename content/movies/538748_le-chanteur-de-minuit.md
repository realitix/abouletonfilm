So he is very happy the day he is offered a post as a music teacher in a college for young women. But he soon realizes the job is only a mixed blessing as a group of girls have set about making life tough for him. Among them is Anny Laforcade, a student who finally changes sides, taking pity on her teacher and falling in love with him. At one point, Jean meets Z\u00e9bulon, a talent agent who decides to launch his singing career. Z\u00e9bulon has a far-fetched idea: He asks Anny to disappear for a few days thus making people believe that she has committed suicide out of love for Jean. The latter, who is not aware of the scheme, is devastated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/woGVp201pgjs7Mw32QkBy1pBQ8G.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
