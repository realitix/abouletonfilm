It's a world of circles - often seen from above: an espresso cup, a stairwell, the pills, and the records spinning. At the dance where the music plays, the rhythms evoke images of a butcher slicing head cheese, gears driving other wheels and levers, a combine churning out bales of hay, a butcher cutting chunks of meat for a stew, and boxers punching. The circle of music and life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AfxfPzUgJkqnb8WJKBBuZ0057VO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [262054, 104342, 254268, 224382], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
