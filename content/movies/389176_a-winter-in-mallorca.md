They have even shipped a piano to the site, so that Chopin can continue his work. However, what promised to be a warm, sunny vacation turns sour as the locals disapprove of Sand, the servants are surly and mysterious, and the monastery is cold. She has her revenge, however. She wrote the book A Winter in Mallorca about her miserable winter retreat. This film follows that book closely, with concern for historical accuracy, which did not increase the Spanish filmmakers' popularity with their countrymen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sGFGYcgYtQUPVcYogAYGiFkEa2w.jpg", "actors": ["Lucia Bos\u00e9 ()", "Christopher Sandford ()", "Daria Esteva ()", "Serena Vergano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
