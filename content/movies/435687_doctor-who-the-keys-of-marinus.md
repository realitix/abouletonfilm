The travellers are forced by the elderly Arbitan to retrieve four of the five operating keys to a machine called the Conscience of Marinus, of which he is the keeper. These have been hidden in different locations around the planet to prevent them falling into the hands of the evil Yartek and his Voord warriors, who plan to seize the machine and use its originally benevolent mind-influencing power for their own sinister purposes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/66GoqwOMLuT0yG20EOWfrfZXRu6.jpg", "actors": ["William Hartnell (The Doctor)", "Carole Ann Ford (Susan Foreman)", "Jacqueline Hill (Barbara Wright)", "William Russell (Ian Chesterton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
