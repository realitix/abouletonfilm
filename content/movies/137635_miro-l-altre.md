Portabella was not interested in simply filming a testimonial documentary. However, he said he would do the film if after the exhibit Joan Mir\u00f3 himself, with the help of the cleaning staff erased his own painting. Joan Mir\u00f3 accepted the idea without a doubt. The complicity between the film maker and the painter is evident in the filming.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fuhuBmzejZjOUimDyGQWUJToUKy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
