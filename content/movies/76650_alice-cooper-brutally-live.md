That he's old enough to be almost anyone in the audience's (grand?)father is quite beside the point. For Alice remains one of the few who knows that rock &amp; roll should be fun, even if that means severed heads, gushing blood, and murdered babies. Even the fabled guillotine, from his heyday a quarter-century ago, makes an appearance. Alice also takes a shot at Marilyn Manson, Ozzy Osbourne, and Kiss by calling them \"my undisciplined children.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e4wz1nD0vB7sXtnljAe2PANNUMe.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Cooper (Vocals)", "Eric Singer (Drums)", "Ryan Roxie (Guitar)", "Pete Freezin' (Guitar)", "Greg Smith (Bass)", "Teddy Andreadis (Keyboards)", "Calico Cooper (The Nurse / Whipdancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [159547], "youtube_key": "AfCmo_dKYkw"}
