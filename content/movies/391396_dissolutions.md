Even as an admitted fan, I can still tell the difference between good and band documentaries. This is one that has an authentic feel and Paul comes across as down to earth as he talks about what he's been going through over the years  in trying to keep a band together.I liked hearing from his former band mates and I gained some behind-the scenes type insights. This is not a glossy, hi-tech scripted type piece - it takes on a grittier, less-sappy, and  unvarnished tone   more indicative of Wedlock's style; especially in their earlier days. I cannot say this film will attract much attention outside Wedlock's small fanbase, but I liked what I saw."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7PyDYrlOOEI"}
