Having hired ruffians to make him look like a superior swordsman, he arranges for himself the opportunity of a profitable marriage. He hires the half-blind masseur Takuetsu (Sawamura Sounosuke) to seduce or rape his wife (Kyoko Mikage), so that she can be divorced or killed for adultery. But the masseur takes pity & informs Oiwa of her husband's horrid plot. Assisted by the merchant's daughter he intends to marry, Iyemon disfigures his wife attempting to poison her so he can marry higher. There's a lovingly gruesome sequence as she combs blad patches into her hair, kneeling deformed at her mirror, weeping with bitterness. She eventually cuts her own throat, swearing revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2sIgwwX6k2tOuP19IPjtlB3IGLS.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuko Inano (Oiwa)", "Kei Sat\u014d (Iyemon)", "Yoshihiko Aoyama (Yomoshichi, a Samurai)", "Akiji Kobayashi (Naosuke)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
