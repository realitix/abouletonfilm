The film presents a sequence of close-up shots of a male and a female mouth that trade gestures and expressions, creating an ambiguous dialogue, an oblique reference to the hardships of a female artist and the censorship and violence of the Brazilian dictatorship.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
