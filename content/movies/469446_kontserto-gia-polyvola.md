The category is right. The girl was blackmailing herself with the life of her brother studying in Italy. She does not make any effort to defend herself and is indifferent if she is sentenced to death, but she accepts the cooperative proposal proposed by General Darius, that is to continue to channel secret documents to the Italians, but now they are deliberately made to deceive the enemy . The whole case is also involved with a captain, Theodorou, who is in love with Niki. Theodorou is arrested for misappropriation of documents and goes through a military court where he is sentenced to demolition and death. Certainly, his execution was fictitious, and on the day Greek troops enter Kor\u00e7a, he is shown alive to Niki, which does not hide her surprise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nWkOv0U4WxTlsK7AADgZSsbMl7m.jpg", "actors": ["Jenny Karezi (Niki)", "Kostas Kazakos (Alexis Theodorou)", "Manos Katrakis (Major General Dareios)", "Andreas Barkoulis (Franco Pizziolli)", "Spyros Kalogirou (Agent)", "Angelos Antonopoulos (Major)", "Zoras Tsapelis (General)", "Dimitris Bislanis (Secret policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
