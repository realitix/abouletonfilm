At first Eugenio's sister Idalina assists him in creating the character of Maria da Luz. Touched by her sweetness and apparent loving nature, the trucker willingly sends her money. When Idalina starts fearing they will be caught, she backs out of her arrangement with Eugenio who then convinces his young cellmate Vasco to help write the letters and even sends a picture of himself at age seven to \"prove\" that Maria has a young son. As prison life exacts an increasingly heavy toll upon Eugenio's health, his feminine alter-ego helps sustain him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/72flNLffDUgeiWyquXiInbO8JDK.jpg", "actors": ["Canto e Castro (Eug\u00e9nio)", "Francisco Nascimento (Vasco)", "Henrique Viana (Abel)", "Zita Duarte (Idalina)", "Rita Blanco (Rute)", "Rog\u00e9rio Samora (Warden)", "Jos\u00e9 Mora Ramos (Chief Guard)", "Heitor Louren\u00e7o (Guard #1)", "Jos\u00e9 Pinto (Barbas)", "Fernando Heitor (Paramedic)", "Catarina Furtado (Visitor)", "Paulo Oom (Porter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
