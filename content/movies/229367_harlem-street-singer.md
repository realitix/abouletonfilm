Not only is he one of the greatest folk guitar players of all time, he also represents the sweep of popular music in America during the twentieth century. Harlem Street Singer traces his journey from the tobacco warehouses of the rural south to the streets of Harlem, and onto the 1960s folk music scene, a blind street musician and itinerant preacher who rose out of abject poverty to influence a generation of musicians from Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott to the Grateful Dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21dcMLY7twS9R5MOQOs9DMgtT3d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ygDs_pkEHDs"}
