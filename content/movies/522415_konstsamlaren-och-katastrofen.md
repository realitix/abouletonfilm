Private art collector Theodor \"Teto\" Ahrenberg obtained art directly by artists like Picasso, Chagall and Matisse. He became friends with the international artists elite. And therefore developed a conflict with the Swedish art establishment. The Director of the Modern museum Pontus Hult\u00e9n became his nemesis. Revenge to Theodor Ahrenberg would be creating his own art museum of Stockholm.
