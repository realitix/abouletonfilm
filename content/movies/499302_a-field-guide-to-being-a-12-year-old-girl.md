This inquisitive cross between a documentary and a theatre piece was created by Tilda Cobham-Hervey and twelve 12-year-old girls, where real girls articulate what they hope for, what they remember and what it feels like to be twelve. Performing themselves in a filmed field guide, together these specimens investigate their own species.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Rw11hnQsAyCa2URMuypzqioi8.jpg", "actors": ["Tilda Cobham-Hervey (Herself/Narrator)", "Audrey Mason-Hyde (Herself)", "Lila O'Donnell (Herself)", "Lola Tripodi-Smith (Herself)", "Cadence Lopresti-Zotti (Herself)", "Karoline Steiner (Herself)", "Trinity Dent (Herself)", "Grace Wilson (Herself)", "Athieng Akol (Herself)", "Hannah Beard (Herself)", "Azalea Kadija Li (Herself)", "Mabel-Jean Lochowiak (Herself)", "Navya Kumar (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
