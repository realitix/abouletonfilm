It's a perfect subject, in other words, for Verdi, and it was undoubtedly the nature of the storyline, much more than any commission for the new opera house in Cairo (which he repeatedly refused) or the grand occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal, that encouraged him to return to opera composition in 1871, and he would return in style with a magnificent work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/livQNoJT0TsGvmWRDGxxWSB7mtC.jpg", "actors": ["Violeta Urmana (Aida)", "Johan Botha (Radames)", "Dolora Zajick (Amneris)", "Roberto Scandiuzzi (Ramfis)", "Carlo Guelfi (Amonasro)", "Stefan Koc\u00e1n (Il Re)", "Jennifer Check (Gran Sacerdotisa)", "Adam Laurence Herskowitz (Mensajero)", "Daniele Gatti (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
