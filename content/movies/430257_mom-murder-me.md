Annabel, young and free-spirited living in San Francisco, faces this awful truth when her mother, Joan, unexpectedly visits from her small Midwestern hometown. When Annabel\u2019s elderly neighbor passes away, Joan insists it\u2019s murder. Annabel dismisses the theory as Joan\u2019s usual hysteria about big city living until Annabel herself stumbles across another body right before it disappears. Without evidence for the police, Annabel blunders through a comical investigation with Joan as her only ally and a murderer who may be on to their amateur sleuthing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5tucjUjHQOoBSKr3gMlCUwEteqN.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Klaren (Annabel)", "Kathy Garver (Joan)", "Gino Scandur (Pete)", "Olando Graves II (Buck)", "C.S.
