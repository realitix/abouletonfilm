Referencing everyone from Marlowe to Shaft, SAPPHIRE AND THE SLAVE GIRL situates its analysis in the persona of the hard-boiled detective in order to highlight transgressions of identity and location. Featuring a multifarious cast of identity-shifting Sapphires, this fast paced genre-bash visualizes and problematizes how identity is negotiated and performed within urban spaces.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
