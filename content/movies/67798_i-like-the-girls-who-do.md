But there is a unique stipulation standing in the way of its collection. The sexually inexperienced Johnny has seven days to bed the last seven women that his uncle had seduced. All of them are young, lusty and insatiable beauties who gladly obey the uncle's dying request and show Johnny all there is to know about around-the-clock lovemaking and more! But as Johnny's triumphs and pleasures mount from girls one through six, he discovers that his seventh and final conquest - the most luscious vixen of all - may be a little harder to achieve.
