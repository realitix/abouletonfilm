We asked them each to write a single line for us \u2014 not a scene, a script or a scenario, but simply an intriguing, amusing or captivating line of dialogue.  Then we gave these lines to one of the great movie artists of our time: the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, a two-time Oscar winner. Kaminski used these lines as inspiration to create 11 original (very) short films. Each short evokes a style or genre of the cinematic past and stars an actor who gave an especially memorable performance in 2013.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j2nNchRu2GZqOGmNY8Ayx7cmw0n.jpg", "actors": ["Cate Blanchett (Woman)", "Bradley Cooper (Man)", "Chiwetel Ejiofor (Man)", "Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos (Woman)", "Greta Gerwig (Woman)", "Oscar Isaac (Man)", "Michael B.
