There is a clear progression from one year to the next as Tori grows in confidence and skill as a live performer, bouyed by the critical and commercial success of the album. The tracklisting focuses on 'Little Earthqaukes' and features all the hits from it but there are also rare songs from her early EPs including her distinctive takes on Led Zeppelin's 'Whole Lotta Love' and 'Thank You', and Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'. This DVD brilliantly captures the vibrancy of Tori Amos' early live perfomances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3aIadDhCWrjRl4zCbPl7neRroBj.jpg", "actors": ["Tori Amos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
