I originally performed it in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival at the Traverse Theatre every morning at 10.30 before restaging it at St Anns Warehouse in New York, The National Theatre in London and The Royal Exchange in Manchester.  This film was made on one single night towards the end of the Manchester run and is the entire show, in real time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6tT4IDuWTbPR7ggnFdQfC8k6PKQ.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Kitson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
