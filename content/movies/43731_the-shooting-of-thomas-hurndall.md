They expect sympathy and co-operation from the Israeli authorities, but are instead met with an official explanation that fails to tally with any eye-witness accounts, and a wall of silence. When an Israeli army report attempts to whitewash the incident, the Hurndalls decide the only way to establish the truth is to launch their own investigation into the shooting, a process which brings them face to face with both the Open-Fire regulations of the Israeli army in Gaza, and the soldier who pulled the trigger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qWD7yaTBYe6Boe1GRpBdNelv4GA.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Dillane (Anthony Hurndall)", "Kerry Fox (Jocelyn Hurndall)", "Matthew McNulty (Tom Hurndall)", "Mark Bazeley (Tom Fitzalan-Howard)", "Harry Treadaway (Billy)", "Jodie Whittaker (Sophie Hurndall)", "Bader Alami (Anis)", "Ziad Backry (Taysir Hayb)", "Denise Gough (Michelle)", "Kika Markham (Alison)", "Tom McKay (Rueben)", "Amr Waked (Mohamed)", "Emma Choy (Australian Reporter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
