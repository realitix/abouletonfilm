It is not surprising then that this period saw the largest number of immigrants arriving at various seaports on the east coast. From 1880 to 1930, about 28.5 million immigrants entered the United States. Statistics show that 70% of immigrants entering the United States in 1885 entered through New York's ports. This fascinating video records some historic moments as boatloads of immigrants step on to the piers in New York.
