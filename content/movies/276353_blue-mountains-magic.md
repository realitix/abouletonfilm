Often compared to the Grand Canyon for its sheer cliffs, rugged canyons and unique flora and fauna, this wilderness will have you reaching for your passport. Also included in the journey are old-fashioned dances, a vintage car race and a steam train ride -- all part of the Blue Mountain experience.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
