Led by Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg but not with obstacles, MGM was the best of the studios at perpetuating the dream that anything was possible, both in front of the cameras and in the lives of Hollywood royalty, namely the movie stars. Within a generation, movies became the largest money making form of entertainment. The public went to see movies in droves even during the depression, wanted to learn about and be close to the personal lives of the Hollywood rich and famous, and aspired to be part of that Hollywood royalty.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dick Cavett (Himself - Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
