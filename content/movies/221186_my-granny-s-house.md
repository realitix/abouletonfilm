After his mother's death, tiny tot S\u00f8ren goes to live with his wilful, rich and stingy Granny, who wants to improve his manners. She also wants to make him sole heir to her fortune, which everybody else covets. Mutual respect, even love, develops between the two. And death by poison enlivens things.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wLEy61v04OnfdCf0VzcntQe1dYj.jpg", "actors": ["Mikkel Egelund (S\u00f8mand)", "Bodil Udsen (Farmor)", "S\u00f8ren Spanning (Far)", "Kirsten Olesen (Johanne)", "Tammi \u00d8st (Vide)", "Laura Faurschou (Beate)", "Vera Gebuhr (Fru Agerlin)", "Erno M\u00fcller (Dr. Agerlin)", "Birgitte Federspiel (Tante Laura)", "Karen Marie L\u00f8wert (Fru Tychsen)", "Olaf Ussing (Lillelund)", "Ole Ernst (Pastor M\u00f8ller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
