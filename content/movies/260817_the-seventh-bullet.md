One of the bands of rebels is led by Khairulla who is pitted against the militsiya (local militia) leader Maxumov. At first it seems hopeless for Maxumov as the rebels capture most of his men, winning them over to his side. He has only one strategy left; to give himself up, and try to explain to the people that Khairulla has deceived them, turning the soldiers back to revolution. Later in pursuit of his enemy, he chases Khairulla across a river. He has only one bullet left -- the seventh, and he must not miss his target!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oC7iIOGrduaI1m2XcNc6rjewSKh.jpg", "actors": ["Dilorom Kambarova ()", "Bolot Beyshenaliev ()", "Talgat Nigmatulin ()", "Melis Abzalov ()", "Inogam Adylov ()", "Anvara Alimova ()", "T.
