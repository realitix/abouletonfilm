For the last two decades, the F\u00fa has been a well-guarded secret among the elite rafters and kayakers of the world, and rightfully so. But the F\u00fa's future might be in jeopardy. Chile has few environmental policies to protect such wild places, and plans for damming the Futaleuf\u00fa to provide hydroelectric power have been floating around for more than a decade. Viewers join travel writer Rick Montgomery along \"the greatest whitewater on earth\" to learn not only the true meaning of adventure, but also the threat of America's largest power company and its fight to control the mighty river and how the community has come together to fight back.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
