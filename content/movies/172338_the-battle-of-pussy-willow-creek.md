Both wickedly satirical and deeply affectionate, The Battle of Pussy Willow Creek tells the \"100% true\" story of how these oddball outsiders saved the Union from a nefarious foreign plot, how the forces of bigotry expunged their stunning victory from the history books, and - most importantly - how meeting one's ex on the field of battle can be just the thing to re-spark a detoured romance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uyM5YjvoXqTMDR2j8daOsMRnwGv.jpg", "actors": ["Emily Mitchell ()", "Christopher Lukas ()", "Tim Cusack ()", "Zeb Hollins III ()", "Matthew Ludwinski (Jonathan Franklin Hale)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "k1r5khBe6Yk"}
