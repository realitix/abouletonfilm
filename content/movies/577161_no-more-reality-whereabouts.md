In the past decades, Parreno has radically redefined the exhibition experience by conceiving this as a scripted space where a series of events unfolds. Now he explores the possibilities of the theatrical film screening as a coherent \u2019object\u2019 rather than a collection of individual films. For the first time, Parreno presents a retrospective of his film works in the diegetic space of the cinema instead of the museum space. Parreno proposes a 'seance of cinema\u2019 reintroducing in this traditional setting the magic and live rituals that lie at the basis of this art form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f6EipKO1j19rVBZRx0VSDUHfcoN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
