It is a documentary on one of the Japanese \"karayuki-san,\" who were women that were taken from their homes in Japan and used as prostitutes in the post-war period. Many of these women were told that they were doing this to support their families because of the extreme poverty that the war left much of Japan to live in. Imamura focuses on a particular such woman who was sent to Malaysia and never returned to Japan. Joan Mellen, in The Waves at Genji's Door, called this film, \"Perhaps the most brilliant and feeling of Imamura's fine documentaries.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qSWkpUXvJl43xYynja5sJZ31iZG.jpg", "actors": ["Kikuyo Zendo (Herself)", "Sh\u014dhei Imamura (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
