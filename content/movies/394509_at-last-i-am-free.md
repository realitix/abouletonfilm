Two voices contend within me.  The mind: \u201cWhy waste ourselves by pursuing the impossible? Within the holy enclosure of our five senses it is our duty to acknowledge the limitations of man.\u201d  But another voice within me \u2013 call it the Sixth Power, call it the heart \u2013 resists and shouts: \u201cNo!

Die every moment, but say: Death does not exist.\u2019\u201d  Nikos Kazantzakis", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
