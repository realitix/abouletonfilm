It has a coherent plot, non-glacial pacing, and there's just enough skin and homoeroticism, filmed just well enough, that you might get some mild titillation out of it. For whatever reason, director David Decoteau actually made an effort this time.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to watch a Brotherhood movie, or more generally a David Decoteau product, make it this one."}], "recommandations_id": [113917], "youtube_key": "vkNytWizXNI"}
