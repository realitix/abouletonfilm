Eddie likes to tell others how good he is, but seldom shows them. Kitty Mayo, an old-time burlesque queen, who is with the McNary Vaudeville Company, advises Eddie to get himself a partner, as his solo abilities can only be stretched so far. He decides to follow her advice and, while in a theatrical supply shop, he sees Rita Carey rehearsing her dancing act that includes a trained duck. Eddie tells Rita he is a good friend of McNary's, and, with him as her partner, her future in show business will be secured. She agrees to join him and Eddie promptly names the act \"Eddie Kehoe and Partner\". Despite his conceit, Rita likes Eddie, as do others in the troupe, including Cleo a little gold-digger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yjhr6PpRfDogcoiqmCQSA6as2rh.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Quillan ()", "Lina Basquette ()", "Carole Lombard ()", "Robert Armstrong ()", "Crauford Kent (McNary the Vaudeville Producer)", "Bessie Barriscale ()", "Richard Tucker ()", "Maurice Black ()", "Joan Bennett (Night Club Patron (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
