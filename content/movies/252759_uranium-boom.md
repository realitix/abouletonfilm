While Grady guards the claim, Brad goes to register it in town, where he meets and marries Jean Williams (Patricia Medina.) Returning to the claim, Brad learns that Jean was once Grady's fiancee. Grady, as one would expect, is somewhat put out and leaves the mine in Brad's hands, while he hooks up with a confidence man and engineers a scheme to break the back of Brad's somewhat rapidly-created mining empire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ow5V6yF7ensdMEwkXnT4O7PBjYo.jpg", "actors": ["Dennis Morgan (Brad Collins)", "Patricia Medina (Jean Williams)", "William Talman (Grady Mathews)", "Tina Carver (Gail Windsor)", "Philip Van Zandt (Navajo Charlie)", "William Henry (Joe McGinnus)", "Gregg Barton (Phil McGinnus)", "Mel Curtis (Phil McGinnus)", "Henry Rowland (Harry)", "S.
