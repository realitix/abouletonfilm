Their restless spirit leads them to defy a criminal gang when they decide to paint the mural of a whale over a threat written in a wall. The love that unites them, their friendship with other artists at La selva- an old house they use as a refuge- and familiar tensions, come together to tell a story where the powerful strength of youth faces fear, violence and the difficulties of growing up.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
