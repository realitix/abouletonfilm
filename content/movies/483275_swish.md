The subject of the film is motion, and it is an attempt to get inside of it. It was made with a moving subject and a moving camera with an open shutter, the result being that each frame is unique, without the smooth continuity that is expected in film. The subject, a female body at close range, provides an intimacy and eroticism. At the same time it can be seen as a modern version of Futurist simultaneity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xyaGP9eJ7Vuv1FMakie20Nja1D4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
