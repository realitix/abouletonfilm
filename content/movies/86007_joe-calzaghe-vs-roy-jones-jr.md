The tale of the tape has them basically even in height, weight and reach. Calzaghe is three years younger than Jones.  Jones comes to the ring first. He promised to come out to a song he recorded himself, but it is hard to hear over the crowd. Calzaghe is up second. His current period of inactivity is the longest of his career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/brEg8RBkHmxK2jVpptTV5BaCRBw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
