Night after night, when Clara is alone, going on with her experiments, the young man awkwardly manoeuvres with a view to declaring his flame. But the cold scientist remains unconcerned. In his trouble, Antoine regularly drops and breaks phials and other test tubes full of dangerous chemical products. He doesn't care when his skin gets into contact with acid. His heart burns too much for him to be able to feel the burning of his skin. And if he can't GIVE his hand to Clara will he really mind to... LOSE it ?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jhZfgDjwqHrGMkHcy97OqVL1exf.jpg", "actors": ["Marianne di Vettimo ()", "Marcel Gotlib ()", "Michel Such ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
