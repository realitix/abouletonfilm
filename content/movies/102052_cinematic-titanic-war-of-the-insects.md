Or so says Annabelle, the hottest, the sexiest, and by far the craziest psycho blonde chick to hit Japan since WWII. Deeply embittered about the whole man's-inhumanity-to-man thing, she enacts a diabolical plot to unleash a swarm of mutant insects on the world that will destroy all living creatures except creepy crawlers.  Ensnared in all this madness is a philandering island-hopping bug collector and his compliant and slightly pregnant wife, a humorless doctor from the mainland, and a United States airman named Charlie, whose way of starting a conversation is to hysterically scream \"Genocide!\" and then go off his rocker like the dedicated military professional he is.  If you want to watch a story where everybody gets their nuclear holocaust on in the grand tradition of radioactive Japanese monster movies, this is the film for you!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tQWez5ulLCoDWucGnuCzmvQUsr9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
