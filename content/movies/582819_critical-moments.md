Though the boy was my own grand-son, it was never seen as a \u2018home-movie\u2019 \u2013 the child\u2019s face is never seen and it was shot over his shoulder - as close to his \u2018point-of-view\u2019 as I could get. As a young man and as my own children grew up, I was greatly intrigued by the book \u2018The Construction of Reality in the Child\u2019 by Swiss psychologist, Jean Piaget.
