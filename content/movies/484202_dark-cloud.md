Adnan (Reha \u00d6zcan) has been a widower for nearly five years, but he acts as if his wife passed only a few weeks ago; he's been trapped in a deep funk for years and has become emotionally unavailable to his teenage son Burak (Kamer Celenk). Adnan doesn't fare much better with the rest of the world, and a long series of screw-ups leads to him losing his job as a parking lot attendant and being named in a lawsuit. While Burak has already moved out of the house and is living with sympathetic relatives, he decides he needs his father back and sets out to free Adnan from his doldrums, though that's more easily said than done", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aLKXLUdGn3m5V29ib8nTJ5I4LNo.jpg", "actors": ["Reha \u00d6zcan ()", "Kamer Celenk ()", "Ye\u015fim Ceren Bozo\u011flu ()", "Haktan Pak ()", "Tolga Sar\u0131ta\u015f ()", "Banu Fotocan ()", "\u015eerif Erol ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
