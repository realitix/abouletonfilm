When Alfa (French rapper Stomy Bugsy) kills his drug-dealer boss in retaliation for a friend\u2019s death, his brother cryptically suggests he leave Paris and \u201cgo toward the river.\u201d Accompanied by sassy Senegalese cousin Marie (Auriele Coulibay), he embarks on a road trip back to his disdained African roots. Pic possesses a picaresque charm, plus feisty persona of Marie. But Bugsy is so unflaggingly morose, it\u2019s hard to understand what Marie sees in him. Pic, yet to find a distrib in France, stands little chance in the U.S.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Stomy Bugsy (Alfa)", "Vincent Byrd Le Sage (Michel)", "Aur\u00e9lie Coulibaly (Marie)", "Doc Gyn\u00e9co (Zeka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
