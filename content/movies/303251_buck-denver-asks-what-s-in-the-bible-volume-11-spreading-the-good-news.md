His arrival at Pentecost gives them the power to share the Good News about Jesus with the whole world, and they don\u2019t waste any time. In Spreading the Good News! [Acts], follow the apostles as they take Jesus\u2019 message from Judea and Samaria to the ends of the earth. Peter spends his time preaching mostly to the Jews, until God shows up and gives the word that the Good News is for everyone (Gentiles included)! It looks like there\u2019s danger ahead when someone named Saul makes it his mission to kill the new Christians, but God has another type of mission in mind for this man. Saul gets an extreme makeover on the road to Damascus when he meets Jesus, becomes a Christian, changes his name to Paul, and spends the rest of his life telling everyone he meets about God\u2019s transforming love!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Tx41KZfVBvk0P3vgtOHkhZcAiJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
