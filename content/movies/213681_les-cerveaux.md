Other than that there's nothing in common between them. I have been expecting a lot from Zack since 'The Hangover', but it was always the near missed opportunities. I'm not saying this was his much needed breakthrough, but quite enjoyable film.\r\n\r\nAn honest man who worked long enough as a guard for a bank, was approached by his ex colleague and her men with an offer. Since he was madly in love with her, he could not say no to it, despite he already got engaged to another woman. As planned the heist goes on and once it was done, he was ditched and ratted out. Now on the run, how he responds to it and the following events decides his fate.\r\n\r\nNot a great comedy nor a heist film, but it had its moments. The casting was good and it was Zack's show. The rest of them were not into that much, except in the final act. Jason Sudeikis was a bonus. His appearance added more fun. Now I know why Jim Carrey opted out. Owen Wilson's part was not good enough in such a small role, he did good though. Watching it for timepass is fine or even for beyond that seems not a bad try.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [331313, 384682, 308266, 274167]}
