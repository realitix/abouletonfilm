The six stories compiled here are indicative of the new version's competent but uneventful nature; scripting, performances, and direction (all hampered by the program's low budget) rarely live up to the plots' potential or the drama and suspense of the original series. Amanda Plummer's Emmy-winning turn as a scientist who travels 50 years into the past to commit a murder in the Season Two episode \"A Stitch in Time\" is the highlight of the disc; the rest (culled from the series' seven-season run) offer well-worn variations on time travel themes. The full-frame disc includes \"The Outer Limits Story,\" which offers talking-head interviews with executive producers Pen Densham and Mark Stern, as well as featurettes on each episode.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h6Y5ykwYUprVQlFWWzw3UpfBEAT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
