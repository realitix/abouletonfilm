A hooded youth carrying a goldfish in a plastic bag walks aimlessly through an underground NYC subway stop that has the look of a Kar Wai Wong film. Through the crowd comes a young woman all in orange, from her hair, sunglasses, lipstick, jewelry, and clothes to her nail polish. She drops a plastic bag containing a goldfish.
