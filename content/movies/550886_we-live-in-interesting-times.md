A second strand of the work is formed by an ostensibly unconnected set of ideas and concerns, dealing with the gradual movement of our social system from a democratic, to an oligarchic global system. The gradual abstraction of the staircase into colour fields, text, the actress singing and repeating a dialog sequence to camera, make a shifting montage without narrative connection. There is no metaphor in this work.It\u2018s a loose bag of ideas, some connected, others just there as images, to be organized by the viewer, not really an essay, but thoughts on despair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g4KkzlhuDKIa3ObzQEvXTygjssy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
