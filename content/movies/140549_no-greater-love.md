Although she has no shortage of new would-be suitors, the memory of her lost love continues to haunt her, so she focuses instead on providing a stable home for the children, rather than marrying. But her forcefulness alienates some of the kids, who have plans of their own and rebel against her. Can she hold her fractured family together, and will she ever overcome her ghosts to shake herself out of martyrdom and have a real life of her own?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/30z2vZAhraff3YMSck6KxIAkiuW.jpg", "actors": ["Kelly Rutherford (Edwina Winfield)", "Chris Sarandon (Sam Horowitz)", "Nicholas Campbell (Malcolm Stone)", "Daniel Hugh Kelly (Ben Jones)", "Michael Landes (George Winfield)", "Gina Philips (Alexis Winfield)", "Simon MacCorkindale (Patrick Kelly)", "Christopher C.
