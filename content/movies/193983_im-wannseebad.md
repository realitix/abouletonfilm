The film is about five minutes long, and sandwiched between these aforementioned shots we see a collection of scenes of bathers on a beach. The majority of them grin at the camera like loons and follow it around like filings attracted to a magnet.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
