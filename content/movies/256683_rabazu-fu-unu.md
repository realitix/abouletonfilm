She carefully conceals from her co-workers in a food factory the fact she wears such undergarments. One day an attractive male co-worker befriends her. When they get close in her apartment he indeed reacts to her rubber fetish with rejection. But they resume dating and now strive to meet each other's need for an intimate friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/X8hIJHLJQL9P0KTMOOd1WO9IDo.jpg", "actors": ["Aino Kishi ()", "Hiroshi Yamamoto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
