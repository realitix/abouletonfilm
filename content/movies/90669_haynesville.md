The film examines the historic find (a formation called the \"Haynesville Shale\") from the personal level as well as from the larger perspective of the current energy picture and pending energy future. As the Haynesville Shale boom erupts, the film focuses on three lives caught in the middle of the find: A single mom takes up the defense of her community's environmental protections, an African American preacher attempts to use the riches to build a school for his congregants and a salt-of-the-earth, self-described \"country boy\" finds himself conflicted as he weighs losing his pristine land to an oil company's offer to make him a millionaire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9DcbOqZBu00km7cczRJVfOD174b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
