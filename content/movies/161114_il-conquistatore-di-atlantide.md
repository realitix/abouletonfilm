A relocated Hercules (KIRK MORRIS of The Witch's Curse) arrives on the scene and sets off to find a kidnapped Nomad princess. He follows her abductors past the Mountain of the Dead, through the City of the Phantoms, to a mysterious castle which turn out to be Atlantis. As if all this wasn't strange enough, Hercules will encounter gold-painted, blue body stocking-wearing, reanimated dead guys; female guards (who are killed if they taste the love of a man); a dying evil queen and her Ming the Merciless wanna-be sorcerer-scientist; and a torturous climax.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ds0QUrmfS2BpmTrjawzBg0m3QLu.jpg", "actors": ["Kirk Morris (Heracles)", "Luciana Gilli (Virna)", "Piero Lulli (Ramir)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
