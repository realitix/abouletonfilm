Though of course, nothing is as easy as it seems as they soon learn when they try to rescue Charles Merriweather, a stamp traveller frozen in time since his last attempt at stamp- travelling, 65 years ago. But Charles turns out to be a girl, his sister Molly! And she is rapidly turning into an old woman. To find a cure, Tommy takes off in a race against the time that leads him and Molly to the exotic and magical South Pacific islands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oZX75HBLoDN9AmXQDF0AA0nwBcG.jpg", "actors": ["Joshawa Mathers, ()", "Michael Stevens ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
