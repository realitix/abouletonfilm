{"tmdb_id": 123384, "title": "Lovers & Murderers", "original_title": "Milenci a vrazi", "slug_title": "lovers-murderers", "date": "2004-12-09", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Lovers &amp; Murderers is about the ongoing war between those who have and those who want to have what the others have. The have-nots see themselves as poor victims trying to get for themselves what is justly theirs. But when the have-nots become haves, they continue to see themselves as victims of the hordes baying for what is justly theirs, and they have neither the energy nor the security to enjoy what they have obtained.  The movie takes place in the microcosm of a small apartment building. The principal goal of the young people who share rooms in the building is to move into their own room and, some day, a real apartment. They scheme to get what they're after: form short-lived alliances, petition, frighten, marry, become pregnant, anything that might work. Lovers &amp; Murderers presents P\u00e1ral's vision of mankind caught in a cyclical process in which ideology pales before the pettiness, cruelty, and self-justification of human nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tAgEzenvhskp9azHWsm5uhd03Y6.jpg", "actors": ["Ji\u0159\u00ed Langmajer (Borek Trojan)", "Ond\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd (Julda Serafin)", "Zlata Adamovsk\u00e1 (Zita Gr\u00e1fov\u00e1)", "Jakub Pracha\u0159 (Roman Gr\u00e1f)", "Kristina Kloubkov\u00e1 (Madda Seraf\u00ednov\u00e1)", "Jan Vlas\u00e1k (Ev\u017een Gr\u00e1f)", "Veronika \u017dilkov\u00e1 (MUDr. D\u00e1\u0161a Z\u00edbrtov\u00e1)", "Marek Tacl\u00edk (Bogan Tu\u0161l)", "Petra \u0160palkov\u00e1 (Jolana Tu\u0161lov\u00e1)", "Marko Igonda (Alex Seraf\u00edn)", "Tereza Duchkov\u00e1 (Evka)", "Danica Jur\u010dov\u00e1 (Bro\u0148a Berkov\u00e1)", "Zuzana Norisov\u00e1 (Jana Ryb\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1)", "Pavel \u0158ezn\u00ed\u010dek (Ing.
