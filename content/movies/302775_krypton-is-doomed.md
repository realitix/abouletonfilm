Highly stroboscopic and hallucinatory, these kinetic performances result in otherworldly spaces and plays of near-abstraction and suggestive imagery. In Krypton is Doomed, the audio accompaniment to the shifting visuals is an installment of a Superman radio play \u2014 the first ever broadcast, in 1940. This work highlights Jacobs' relentless experimentation with the very fabric of projected light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gr8yvrUKzkhOzV7SuZekFYK4tEh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
