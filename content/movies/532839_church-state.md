The film\u2019s ride on the bumpy road to equality in Utah offers a glimpse at the Mormon church\u2019s influence in state politics and the squabbles inside the gay community that nearly derailed a chance to make history.  Church & State is a story of triumph, setback and a little-known lawsuit that should have failed, but instead paved the way for a U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay unions nationwide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i6NieNz1By25uFE5md1M94ZtAFr.jpg", "actors": ["Jennifer Lynn Dobner (Herself - Reporter, the Salt Lake Tribune)", "Mark Lawrence (Himself - Founder, Restore Our Humanity)", "Jim Magleby (Himself - Lawyer - Managing Partner, Magleby & Greenwood)", "Taylor Petrey (Himself - Religious Studies Professor, Kalamazoo College)", "Peggy Tomsic (Herself - Lead Lawyer for the Kitchen Case - Partner, Magleby & Greenwood)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Q215_EU1zDo"}
