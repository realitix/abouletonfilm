Her cinematic universe has influenced entire generations. As a young woman, she brought the international art world to the sleepy town of Konstanz. It all began on the shores of Lake Constance where Ulrike Ottinger was born and where she still often spends time. Filmmaker Brigitte Kramer chose to begin her film at Lake Constance since she too shares Ottinger\u2019s birthplace and a great love of these waters. This is also where the filmmaker\u2019s own artistic development began, not least as a result of her encounter with Ottinger and her work. Other fellow travellers and friends appearing in this film include art historian Katharina Sykora, collector and curator Ingvild Goetz, film historian Ulrich Gregor, philosopher Bernd Scherer and actor Irm Hermann. Using this common ground as a starting point for an exploration of Ottinger\u2019s substantial oeuvre, this documentary provides a keen insight into the artist\u2019s life and work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sRFCG7N0JBbcsDrrXd95XMVVkDW.jpg", "actors": ["Ulrike Ottinger (Herself)", "Ingvild Goetz (Herself)", "Irm Hermann (Herself)", "Eva Mattes (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
