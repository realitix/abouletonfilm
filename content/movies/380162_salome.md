David McVicar\u2019s powerful 2008 production of Strauss's opera \u2013 based on a play by Oscar Wilde \u2013 takes the controversial and disturbing film 120 Days of Sodom as its visual reference. The action is set in a debauched palace, which has suggestions of Nazi Germany. Strauss\u2019s ravishing and voluptuous score adds to the sexual alchemy that is conjured by an international cast led by Nadja Michael in the title role. Salome is filmed for the big screen with High Definition cameras and recorded in true surround sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/80xikJWJhTttS266ZzMkyeMM5AY.jpg", "actors": ["Nadja Michael (Salom\u00e9)", "Michael Volle (Jokanaan)", "Michaela Schuster (Herodias)", "Thomas Moser (Herod)", "Joseph Kaiser (Narraboth)", "Christian Sist (First soldier)", "Alan Ewing (Second soldier)", "Daniela Sindram (Herodias's page)", "Vuyani Mlinde (A Cappadocian)", "Pumeza Matshikiza (A slave)", "Adrian Thompson (First Jew)", "Martyn Hill (Second Jew)", "Hubert Francis (Third Jew)", "Ji-Min Park (Fourth Jew)", "Jeremy White (Fifth Jew)", "Iain Paterson (First Nazarene)", "Julian Tovey (Second Nazarene)", "Duncan Meadows (Naaman (Executioner))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
