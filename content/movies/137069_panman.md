As people start to disappear, a custard professor and a few of his students, band together to try and stop PANMAN.

Lurking on the other side of town is a grizzled culinary professor who is hell bent on forming an assassination squad to kill Panman once and for all. The Professor and his hunters are able to infiltrate Panman's love life and cause disastrous results.
