At the centre of it all is Michael, a music hall artist, who finds Judy, an angel that epitomizes the woman of his dreams at the System Theatre where he is about to open his new show. For Michael it is just another show along the road but once inside something happens. The night is full of possibilities- full of love and romance, jealousy and infidelity, music and dance, even good and evil. Most of all it is full of magic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ndkZWrF8fMDIqviNvKEpF8GlRwU.jpg", "actors": ["Carole Laure (Judy)", "Nick Mancuso (Michael)", "St\u00e9phane Audran (Janice)", "Jean Carmet (Sam)", "Lyne Tremblay (Stardust)", "Danielle Godin (Moonbeam)", "Barbara Eve Harris (Doubt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
