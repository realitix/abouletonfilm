Withers capably essays the part of a teenaged movie star who tires of the spotlight and runs away from Hollywood. Adopting an alias, she joins \"The Junior Victory Caravan\", a group of youthful USO performers. She also pursues a romance with much-older playwright Henry Wilcoxon, only to be (deliberately) disillusioned by the man. Among the juvenile favorites making cameo appearances in Johnny Doughboy are Bobby Breen, Baby Sandy, Butch &amp; Buddy, Cora Sue Collins, Robert Coogan (Jackie's brother) and ex-\"Little Rascals\" George \"Spanky\" McFarland and Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yrRj8BoxKTJinqs21TwOqHmHyVT.jpg", "actors": ["Jane Withers (Ann Winters / Penny Ryan)", "Henry Wilcoxon (Oliver Lawrence)", "Patrick Brook (Johnny Kelly)", "William Demarest (Mr. Harry Fabian)", "Jack Boyle Jr. (Johnny Kelly)", "William Demarest (Harry Fabian)", "Ruth Donnelly (Biggy Biggsworth)", "Etta McDaniel (Mammy)", "Joline Westbrook (Jennifer Lawrence)", "Bobby Breen (Bobby Breen)", "Baby Sandy (Baby Sandy)", "Carl Switzer (Alfalfa)", "George McFarland (Spanky McFarland)", "Kenneth Brown (Buddy)", "Billy Lenhart (Butch)", "Cora Sue Collins (Cora Sue Collins)", "Robert Coogan (Robert Coogan)", "Grace Costello (Grace Costello)", "The Falkner Orchestra (The Falkner Orchestra)", "Karl Kiffe (Karl Kiffe)", "Jackie Brown (Newsboy)", "Arthur Q.
