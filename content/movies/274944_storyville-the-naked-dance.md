Storyville got its name when Alderman Sidney Story attempted to clear up the New Orleans waterfront by restricting prostitution to a specific neighborhood. To his chagrin, the area was dubbed \"Storyville,\" and it was so known until the U.S. Navy closed it for good in 1917.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dN8S8auy3C6lHQUbqVWLINNBG3y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
