Using 300 hours of footage shot over the course of three years, the film follows a battle-tested Afghan General and the steady stream of U.S. National Guard soldiers deployed to train the men of his newly formed battalion. It is the first film to examine the reality of building a functioning Afghan military-- but it is also a story about friendship and the unlikely bonds that form across cultural, political and social barriers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dd7yKnysgNSRjY2dvjYZLnFlP5Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
