Magoo proceeds to show the cameramen the various rooms and exhibits of his house. Unfortunately, his publicity is threatened by a burglar and his trained gorilla who break into Magoo's house and attempt to rob it. Of course, Magoo doesn't notice the gorilla (he even mistakes it for Waldo) and reassures the cameramen that Waldo will be all right even if he does have \"the manners of a gorilla\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jim Backus (Mr. Magoo)", "Daws Butler (Waldo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
