French doctor Henrik takes her to his clinic, for rehabilitation purposes, and falls in love with her as does his friend, Si Lahssen, the reigning prince of this small Moroccan state. When a plague falls on the town, Saadia is convinced she is responsible, and rides alone into the mountain country to retrieve the plague serum being held for ransom by bandits. The love triangle dominates most of the rest of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tbXdUtc9vTkI5fvlcXSlRcCGTN5.jpg", "actors": ["Cornel Wilde (Si Lahssen)", "Mel Ferrer (Henrik)", "Rita Gam (Saadia)", "Michel Simon (Bou Rezza)", "Cyril Cusack (Khadir)", "Wanda Rotha (Fatima)", "Marcel Poncin (Moha)", "Anthony Marlowe (Captain Sabert)", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vallier (Zoubida)", "Mahjoub Ben Brahim (Ahmed)", "Jacques Dufilho (Bandit leader)", "Bernard Farrel (Lt.
