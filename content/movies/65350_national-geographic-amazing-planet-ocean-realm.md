But how did they form and why haven't they evaporated? Starting with the primordial weather burped out of the molten earth and rained back to earth as liquid, National Geographic investigates the awesome power of our water world. Hold on tight as our time-machine propels you backwards and forwards through the geological history of our truly Amazing Planet. We'll journey from the mind-bending beauty of coral reef shallows to the deepest depths of the Mariana Trench while glimpsing everything in between. We'll take a wild ride as the great oceans generate our wildest weather, and we'll even get to take a peak into our ocean's possible future.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
