Fifty years later, Portland artist Matt McCormick found that scrapbook in a thrift store, and in 2010 set out on the road, following their route as precisely as possible and searching out every stop in which the ladies had documented. Patiently shot with an observational, cinema-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 approach, The Great Northwest is a lyrical time- capsule that explores how the landscape, architecture, and culture of the Pacific Northwest has changed over the past fifty years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aBqbfS4PAA8cOsgaxZXJzBMIdpU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
