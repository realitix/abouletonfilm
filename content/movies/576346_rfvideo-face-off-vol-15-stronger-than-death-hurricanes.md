One half of the Hardy Boys Matt Hardy and Shane Helms broke into the business around the same year and their careers pretty much paralleled each other.  One went into the WWE with his brother and the other started out in WCW as a cruiserweight.  Both men met for the first time as they put in their hours doing the local indy scene in the Carolinas.  Their paths crossed for the first time in Omega where they both learned the ropes and started their journey to superstardom.For the first time ever RF VIDEO brings together both men to discuss the current state of the pro wrestling business in 2012.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Matt Hardy (Himself)", "Gregory Shane Helms (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
