Filmed by Takehisa Kosugi's mentor Matsu Ohno (perhaps best known in the States for his sound effects/score work on the television series Astro-Boy), the film moves at the same pace as the music itself, a pastoral road movie following a band far more likely to play temples than clubs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hUW0f9K7diehMR0WrUtDpc9FQCW.jpg", "actors": ["Michihiro Kimura ()", "Ryo Koike ()", "Seiji Nagai ()", "Takehisa Kosugi ()", "Tokio Hasegawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
