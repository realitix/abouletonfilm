The ambiguity of the \"double screen\" lies in the fact that it does not systematically involve twice as many images, but diversified spatial and temporal interactions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iOXkagqff28zhp4ntSexfpc0wvI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
