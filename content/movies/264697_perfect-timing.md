But, having made his mark, allowed the artist within to be released. Creatively and artistically, Harry has moved on; his work now consisting of portraits and interpreting rock wall fractals. Of course that meant leaving the professional schlock of commercial advertising behind him. Sounds good. Except there's that pesky issue of money. And Harry and his buds are quickly burning through large quantities of it. Bottom line - he's nearly broke and faces eviction.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paul Boretski (Joe)", "Stephen Markle (Harry)", "Michael Rudder (Ziggy)", "Eddie Roy (Zack Black)", "Wally Martin (Delivery Man)", "Richard Zeman (Muscle Man #1)", "Michele Scarabelli (Charlotte)", "Nancy Cser (Lacy)", "Mary Beth Rubens (Judy)", "Kelly Craig (Leslie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
