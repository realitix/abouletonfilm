In July 2009, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gerard Martinez walked into a Tampa Bay museum with a gun and killed 10 people - men, women and children - before turning the gun on himself. In the days leading up to the murders, he was making a documentary on what had become his obsession: Proving the existence of Mon Protecteur, a mythical French super hero. This documentary uses his footage, police evidence and interviews with his friends, family, colleagues, historians and others to paint a clear picture of the obsession that drove Martinez to the edge and to try to figure out if Martinez actually found the mythical hero or if he simply found a con man.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
