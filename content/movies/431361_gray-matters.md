Making a reputation with her traditional lacquer work in the first decade of the 20th century, she became a critically acclaimed and sought after designer and decorator in the next before reinventing herself as an architect, a field in which she laboured largely in obscurity.  Apart from the accolades that greeted her first building \u2013persistently and perversely credited to her mentor\u2013her pioneering work was done quietly, privately and to her own specifications.  But she lived long enough (98) to be re-discovered and acclaimed.
