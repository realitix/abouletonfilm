He has built his own subsistence conditions. He often goes to the neighboring villages, although he doesn\u2019t communicate with other people. He collects some waste but doesn\u2019t beg. He prowls about the ruins of deserted villages, as an animal or as a ghost. Under double political and economical pressure, most of people are depriving of their last dignity into a world where it exists a lack of material and spirit. But a human being stays a human being. He is looking for reasons to continue to live. \u2014Wang Bing", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/FEzdQf9RUQiQSqLfjCNE6jHgjn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [65720, 310799, 108831, 110379], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
