One night the crew killed him, and marooned the mate and the captain's daughter by sending them adrift in a small boat. Days passed upon the vast expanse of ocean, and their food was all gone and death near, when land was sighted and their boat was cast up on a coral reef, and they with difficulty made the shore. Fear of death was soon supplanted in the heart of the captain's daughter by fear of a man loving her all too well. The mate, seeing this and realizing the strength of his passion, decided to live on the side of the island, but as the months passed away his loneliness overcame him and he made his way to where she sat reading. He looked over her shoulder, and saw that she read the marriage service.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Frank Clark (The Ship's Captain)", "Bessie Eyton (The Captain's Daughter)", "Hobart Bosworth (The First Mate)", "Tom Santschi (The 'Sea Lawyer')", "Frank Opperman (The Man at the Wheel)", "Betty Harte ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
