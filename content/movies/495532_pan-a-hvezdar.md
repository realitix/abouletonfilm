A certain refinement is the framing of the whole story with a puppet show that moves into the played scenes. The film carries out a folk tale of a stupid castle lord who lives in a ruined castle, a fraudulent painter and a lazy shepherd.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6DRFUc9pf8IoZxMpOb8dsvPeeFK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
