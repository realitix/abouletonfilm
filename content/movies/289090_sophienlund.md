On their sons' 21st birthday, Eckberg tells them the great family secret:  Knut and Michael aren't his children (happy birthday, kids ... oh!  and did I mention Santa Claus doesn't exist either?).  But thankfully, the news gets better:  their real mother died giving birth to them (guilt trip ... guilt trip!) and the Eckbergs decided to adopt the boys and bring them up in a proper family (no doubt so they could shatter their lives with this tale on their 21st birthday).  But hey:  it made everyone forget about the War going on outside the theatre, right?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x022H1yTnaG9s4CVQcnq5ddveWl.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Liedtke (Erick Eckberg)", "K\u00e4the Haack (Sigrid Eckberg)", "Hannelore Schroth (Gabriele Eckberg)", "Hans Quest (J\u00fcrgen)", "Jeanette Bethge (Selma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
