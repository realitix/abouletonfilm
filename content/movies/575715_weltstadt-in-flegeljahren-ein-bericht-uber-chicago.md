This voyage resulted in a book, \u2018Dirt Tracks to Chicago,\u2019 and a silent \u2018city\u2019 film, WORLD CITY IN ITS TEENS. Whereas the book covers his entire journey, Hauser\u2019s film concentrates on Chicago, with its skyline, skyscrapers, motorized traffic, local industries, labor, mechanized production, and places for leisure. [\u2026] Though Hauser considered Chicago to be \u2018the most beautiful city in the world,\u2019 his city symphony is notable for its critique of the modern American city, and of the United States in general.\u201d \u2013Eva Hielscher, THE CITY SYMPHONY PHENOMENON", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
