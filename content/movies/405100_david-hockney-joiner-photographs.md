In the late 1970s the British artist developed a pioneering concept which also changed his perspective on painting \u2013 his \u201cjoiners\u201d. In this film, the artist himself talks about this photographic approach, a kind of Cubism-inspired photocollage which explores the space-time continuum. Hockney allows the viewer to share in the creative \u201cjoiner\u201d process and leads us step by step into the universe of his artistic creativity.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cGtraVb_0vY"}
