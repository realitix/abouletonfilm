The film's song-like structure alternates between Western prophecies of the USSR's ruin and energetic live footage to the contrary. The Russian proletarian is shown to thrive in industry, battle, and space exploration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m5T6BfnxeGZG73zrJJirTZoPRXZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
