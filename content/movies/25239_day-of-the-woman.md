At the end of the film, I didn't have the slightest notion that I had seen anything that informed me or had done me any good whatsoever. I'm all for films that challenge, that rattle cages, as long as they have a point to make. I can sit through the most abhorrent, violent, perverse,terrifying and disturbing film, as long as when the credits roll, I feel I've learned something, either about a subject and/or myself by doing so. With this, there's no such insight to be gained. It's a nasty film, devoid of any purpose other than to shock and disgust. In these two objectives at least, it succeeds."}], "recommandations_id": [15516, 20850, 27475, 8691]}
