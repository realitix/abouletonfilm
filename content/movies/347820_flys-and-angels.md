Born and raised in the Ukraine in the period between Stalin and Gorbatschow he left the country in the 80s. In his Installations and his numerous paintings Kabakov creates a world of its own, which leaves the heaviness of socialist and post-socialist life far behind. The film links Ilya Kabakovs artistic spaces with insights into Russian everyday life, which itself sometimes appears like an installation by the artist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hgWGyXFzf4U8OvFezueIIs0pRAK.jpg", "actors": ["Ilya Kabakov (Himself)", "Emilia Kabakov (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
