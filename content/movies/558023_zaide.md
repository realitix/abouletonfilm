Composed in 1780, two years before The Abduction from the Seraglio, Zaide contains melodies of incredible inventiveness. The opera lacks an overture, a finale and many spoken dialogues, yet the missing elements allowed Sellars to elaborate and transform the work into a grand manifesto against slavery. Sellars' vision provoked a scandal, as it had previously in Vienna and London, but the Cour de l'Archev\u00each\u00e9 has experienced plenty of scandals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zH2E7a0dwzL4dKv08csyCN4L6Z2.jpg", "actors": ["Ekaterina Lekhina ()", "Sean Panikkar ()", "Alfred Walker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
