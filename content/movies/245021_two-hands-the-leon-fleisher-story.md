A seemingly minor accident - a cut on his right thumb - led to dystonia, the involuntary curling of his right hand's ring and little fingers. In recent interviews, Fleisher talks about what followed: the end of a marriage, despair and disappointments, surgery in 1983 that led to a brief return to the concert hall, and, finally, with Botox and Rolfing, the ability to play with two hands. In between, Fleisher discovers his ecstasies: conducting, teaching, and playing compositions for one hand commissioned in the early twentieth century for a World War I veteran.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tecjXsi4gqYwbqccKVkf34StFSg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
