A rather talentless would-be hack substitutes his own script for the work of a deceased roommate who actually has some financing in place, and the result is a hilariously tasteless film within a film High School Shootings -The Musical. Over a hundred Vancouver area film school graduates, friends and musicians worked on this film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yf0ZG2Pc65hFLOK0RQjWCVCvOEl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
