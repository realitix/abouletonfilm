Artist, poet, surrealist, philosopher, warrior, general, cynic, statesman, spoiled son of a rich man, genius war leader or a bon vivant? A Serb who learned French language before his own, a convinced communist who made fun of the communist dogma, sportsman, vice-president of Yugoslavia who drove to work in his Spacek? Answers to these questions could be: all of this and none of it really. In fact, who is Koca Popovic remains a mystery even today. A mystery that this film will at least try to unravel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4fc5KSdLvQigwekwftlwA1iHN7B.jpg", "actors": ["Tihomir Stani\u0107 (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
