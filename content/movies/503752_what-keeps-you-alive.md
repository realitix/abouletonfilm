Plus the fact that the homosexuality of the leads was just an accepted fact about the characters, not the point of the story (even if that story was still a bit grim) which literally just yesterday I was asking for. Unfortunately, every character makes decisions that are so stupid and non-human it verges on absurdity, which detracted from my enjoyment hugely.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [431185, 448194, 401272, 463322]}
