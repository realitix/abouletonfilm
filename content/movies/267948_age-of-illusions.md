Andras Balint plays an electrical engineer who hops from bed to bed, never making any lasting commitment with any one woman. All this changes when he falls in love with a local celebrity whom he sees on television (Ilona Beres). Trouble is, he's never met her; like her other fans, he can assess her only by what he witnesses on the small screen. When he finally does touch base with the girl, he's in for a few surprises-some pleasant, many others not so. Completed in 1965, Age of Illusions was not given widespread distribution until 1967.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A9BNMnCf6MO1EOvpowGxUb7PDhe.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e1s B\u00e1lint (Jancsi)", "Ilona B\u00e9res (Halk \u00c9va)", "Hal\u00e1sz Judit (Habgab)", "Kati S\u00f3lyom (Anni)", "Eszterg\u00e1lyos Cec\u00edlia (\u00c1gi)", "B\u00e9la Asztalos (Laci)", "Tam\u00e1s Er\u00f6ss (Matyi)", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Mur\u00e1nyi (Gergely)", "Istv\u00e1n D\u00e9k\u00e1ny (F\u00fcsi)", "Mikl\u00f3s G\u00e1bor (Flesch f\u00f5m\u00e9rn\u00f6k)", "Sinkovits Imre (Harrer)", "J\u00e1nos Rajz (Zsoldos \u00far)", "Bujtor Istv\u00e1n (\u00c1gi els\u00f5 szerelme)", "Dorottya G\u00e9czy (N\u00f5 a parton)", "Fredi Haber (Zongorista)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37621, 263112, 64074, 110761], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
