During 'sessions' with the mysterious, masked Herold, her life unfolds before our eyes and we will learn about everything: Istanbul, Germany, family, friends, drugs and death. \"Should I Really Do It?\" plays with these concepts of real life and fiction, documentary and drama. Could life ever be more interesting than fiction?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/16ZGHulQUWQ1ajkcUV1b7o46HPu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
