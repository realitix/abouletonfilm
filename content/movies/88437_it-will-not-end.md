And it's through his sarcastic perspective that we follow the story of the Croatian war veteran Martin. He falls in love with a beautiful girl who plays Little Red Riding Hood in a porn version of the fairy tale. She is also a prostitute. To be with her, Martin has to buy her from her pimp. A tragicomic story of love in a world where it seems all human values are put up for sale or destined for cynical destruction", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lXb2VaJjsF5UGV8hn0H7CZvtpF1.jpg", "actors": ["Ivan Herceg (Martin)", "Nada \u0160argin (Desa)", "Predrag 'Pre\u0111o' Vu\u0161ovi\u0107 (\u0110uro)", "Inge Appelt (Marija / \u017daklina)", "Dra\u017een Kuhn (Kriminalac)", "Mladen Vuli\u0107 (Nikola)", "Leon Lu\u010dev (Martinov kolega)", "Damir Orli\u0107 (Martinov kolega II)", "Ljubomir Kereke\u0161 (Doktor)", "Ana Begi\u0107 (Emina)", "Tanja Pjevac (Kurva I)", "Ivana V.
