Because the patchwork constellation with several involuntarily connected families puts their nerves to the test. To kitten the fragile relationship with her 14-year-old daughter Saskia, she has invited all family members to their confirmation. But Saskia has recently moved to her father and his new family, while the son of Katrins new partner Philipp has moved in with them and since then devastated Saskia's room and Katrins life. It is impossible to think of a harmonious everyday life, let alone a peaceful family celebration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g94v31fQcxP9oFDL88DB32Uk104.jpg", "actors": ["Nicolette Krebitz (Katrin Wiedemann)", "Franziska Weisz (Sabine Esch)", "Hary Prinz (Philipp Esch)", "Emilie Neumeister (Saskia Wiedemann)", "Luis August Kurecki (Leo Wiedemann)", "Oskar B\u00f6kelmann (Yannik Esch)", "Daniela Ziegler (Diana Wiedemann)", "Marie Gruber (Renate Koch)", "Peter Prager (Horst Koch)", "Lisa Bitter (Julia Schl\u00f6sser)", "Clara Veihelmann (Ella Schl\u00f6sser)", "Hannah Veihelmann (Lena)", "Julian Gutmann (Finn)", "Matthias Brenner (Polizist)", "Philipp Oehme (Polizist)", "Juergen Maurer (Frank Wiedemann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
