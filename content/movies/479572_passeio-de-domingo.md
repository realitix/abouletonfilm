During the weekly Sunday drive all falls apart. It starts with a claustrophobic car trip through town. Nagging children, football on the radio, a mother in law with a sharp tongue, a new pregnancy. It is a day of unhappiness, a day that will turn around their lives. An anti-Sunday. Sunday Drive is Jose Miguel Ribeiro's second film after his much awarded short 'The Suspect'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yq2i5Pg0xXatkYqdFpelH7DWe2m.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
