It is a film about what music can do; the way it can transcend cultural barriers, bring people together, defeat prejudice and overcome religious and political differences. It also demonstrates the problems that crop up occasionally and how music can help people from different points of view find common ground. For Daniel Barenboim, founder of the ensemble, the orchestra is a symbol for what could be achieved in the Middle East.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/agFMtxfGZC5uZo7cFyqEltNgrks.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
