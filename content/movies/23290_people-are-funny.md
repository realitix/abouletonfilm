Jack Haley is a producer with only half-rights to the program while Ozzie Nelson and Helen Walker are the radio writers and supply the romance. Rudy Vallee, always able to burlesque himself intentional and, quite often, unintentional, is the owner of the sought-after sponsoring company. Frances Langford, as herself, sings \"I'm in the Mood for Love\" while the Vagabonds quartet (billed 12th and last) chimes in on \"Angeline\" and \"The Old Square Dance is Back Again.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qQd2OuYB50uZkQlx74WEISsvMMY.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Haley (Pinky Wilson)", "Helen Walker (Corey Sullivan)", "Rudy Vallee (Ormsby Jamison)", "Ozzie Nelson (Leroy Brinker)", "Phillip Reed (John Guedel)", "The Vagabonds (Quartet-Singers / Musicians)", "Bob Graham (Luke)", "Roy Atwell (Mr. Pippensigal)", "Clara Blandick (Grandma Wilson)", "Barbara Roche (Aimee)", "Art Linkletter (Art Linkletter)", "Frances Langford (Frances Langford - Guest)", "Ann Jenkins (Boogie Woogie Piano Player)", "William Benedict (NBC Usher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
