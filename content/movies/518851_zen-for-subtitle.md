I have devoted my youth and effort of 4 years of campus life and 2 years of work life. When I have given up translating subtitle, I want to look back to and remember such a bygone by documentary.  Subtitle is equal to public: By this documentary I want to show how a cinephile makes a link with film and makes effect to more cinephile in such a special situation in China. This documentary also displays a tip of the iceberg of the cinephile cultural history in China.  Subtitle is equal to privacy: I hope to experience the progress of subtitle translation again, in order to cast my ambition and burden in the old days. I want to say goodbye to that ego with subtitle translation and move forwards to that ego with indie-documentary direction. I want to search more possibilities to the films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kFpHmBCoJCq5gTfmDfpCBG3Rgr6.jpg", "actors": ["'Xiongzaixia' Tan Jiahao (Himself)", "Lucus Hall ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
