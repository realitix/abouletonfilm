The Telharmonium was a 200-ton behemoth that created numerous musical timbres and could flood many rooms with sound. Beginning with the first instrument, constructed in the 1890's, and continuing with the installation of the second instrument at Telharmonic Hall in New York, the rise and fall of commercial service, the attempted comeback of the third Telharmonium, and ending with efforts to find a home for the only surviving instrument in 1951, this documentary provides a definitive account of the first comprehensive music synthesizer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7fX2ACXuVLOMrQIqkhc0TmdJrG9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
