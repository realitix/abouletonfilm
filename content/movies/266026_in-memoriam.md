Two naked students, apparently making love at the time, fell off the roof of a campus building in Chicago and were killed. Jonathan is appalled that anyone could find this funny. In the painfully true opening scenes of \"In Memoriam,\" he cannot get the deaths out of his mind. He's driven to begin what he calls an \"investigation\" into who the students were and what led them to the rooftop.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Annabel Armour (Deborah)", "Christine Ann Barnes (Apple)", "Delia Baseman (Final four Actress)", "Chris Carr (Ernest)", "Stephen Cone (Eric)", "Ian Forester (Jonathan)", "Nick Horst (Parker)", "Betty Gabriel (Kayla)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
