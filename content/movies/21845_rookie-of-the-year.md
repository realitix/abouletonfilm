After Henry's arm is broken while trying to catch a baseball at school, the tendon in that arm heals too tightly, allowing Henry to throw pitches that are as fast as 103 mph. Henry is spotted at nearby Wrigley Field by Larry \"Fish\" Fisher, the general manager of the struggling Chicago Cubs, after Henry throws an opponent's home-run ball all the way from the outfield bleachers back to the catcher, and it seems that Henry may be the pitcher that team owner Bob Carson has been praying for.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vyfinDLt7gc0wwTRFVBKc81bo6k.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Ian Nicholas (Henry Rowengartner)", "Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine (Becky)", "Gary Busey (Chet Steadman)", "Albert Hall (Martinella)", "Amy Morton (Mary Rowengartner)", "Dan Hedaya (Larry 'Fish' Fisher)", "Bruce Altman (Jack Bradfield)", "Eddie Bracken (Bob Carson)", "Robert Hy Gorman (Clark (as Robert Gorman))", "Patrick LaBrecque (George)", "Daniel Stern (Brickma)", "John Candy (Cliff Murdoch - Announcer (uncredited))", "Jonathan Hilario (Phys Ed Dweeb)", "Tom Milanovich (Heddo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [20726, 26441, 24795, 14819], "youtube_key": "Heoa-AI42bA"}
