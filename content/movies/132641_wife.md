In turn, he alternately ignores her and treats her as a servant. Neither is particularly happy, not helped by their unsatisfactory lodgers. The husband is easily seduced by an ex-colleague, a widow with a small child who needs some security, and considers leaving his wife.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9DMw6CFftuzLYpbftcOFmyZekJ6.jpg", "actors": ["Mieko Takamine (Mihoko Nakagawa)", "Ken Uehara (Toichi, Mihoko's husband)", "Rentar\u00f4 Mikuni (Tadashi Tanimura)", "Michiyo Aratama (Yoshimi Niemura)", "Sanae Takasugi (Setsuko Sakurai)", "Chieko Nakakita (Eiko Matsuyama)", "Yatsuko Tan'ami (Fusako Sagara)", "Hajime Izu (Hirohisa Matsuyama)", "Yoshiko Tsubouchi (Taeko Niemura)", "Tatsuya Ishiguro ()", "Akira Tani ()", "Noriko Honma ()", "Masao Shimizu ()", "Sadako Kimura ()", "Eiji Koyama ()", "Masakichi Mitsui ()", "Hideko Ebata ()", "Tsuruko Mano ()", "Toyomi Shiozawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
