After the film was broadcast, Derek was catapulted from his local to the stages of festivals such as Glastonbury and the Big Chill, becoming celebrated as Britain's oldest DJ and enjoying a successful career. Sadly, in July 2015 Derek went missing and in March 2016 it was confirmed that remains found near Cribbs Causeway, just north of Bristol, were his. As a tribute, BBC Arts has made the complete 1994 documentary available to view.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mzrrY6bcTzCEX7kzA4zJWupbLeQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
