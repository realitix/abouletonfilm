Its LowerTown district is a place where artists from all over the country moved into beautiful old houses, revitalizing a troubled neighborhood with the largest Artist Relocation Program ever. From an egg carver, to a print maker, to a sculptural ceramicist, to an art quilt master, this documentary combines artist profiles with interviews and archival photos to explore city history and the tradition of quilting in America. Lush cinematography meets a diverse music score by composer/performer Josh Coffey (of \"Bawn in the Mash\") in this first feature-length documentary by award-winning filmmaker H. Paul Moon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ytX6StKYDxUjp9J8QsHvKdb1pDE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
