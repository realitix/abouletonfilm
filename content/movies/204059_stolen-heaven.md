To cover their tracks and keep the old man from turning them in, the thieves pretend to arrange his comeback concert. The artifice becomes reality, the pianist makes a triumphant return, and the thieves reform. This 1938 film is not a remake of 1932's Stolen Heaven, which wove an entirely different story about a suicide pact.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5pQH7BCiJC6kQb12wE2UFxEa4YK.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Raymond (Carl)", "Olympe Bradna (Steffi)", "Glenda Farrell (Rita)", "Lewis Stone (Joseph Langauer)", "Porter Hall ('Von' Offer)", "Douglass Dumbrille (Klingman)", "Joe Sawyer (Bako)", "Esther Dale (Lieschen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
