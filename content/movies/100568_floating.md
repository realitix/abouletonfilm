The film stars Norman Reedus as Van, a son shouldering the responsibility of his embittered father, with no one to nurture him through his own pain. Van's father is so engrossed in his own troubles that he fails to emotionally support his son. As Doug, Chad Lowe provides Van with friendship, but more importantly, with the knowledge that a \"perfect life\" isn't always what it seems. After Van and Doug engage in a crime spree that ends in tragedy, father and son finally come together for the first time to transcend mourning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yY2aX3m4gRwUyg5DAmpONJLh0bQ.jpg", "actors": ["Norman Reedus (Van)", "Chad Lowe (Doug)", "Will Lyman (Van's Father)", "Sybil Temchen (Julie (as Sybil Temchen))", "Casey Affleck (Prep #1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZqFVscQUR08"}
