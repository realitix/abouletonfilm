Nice or annoying as he likes, enjoys provoking and transgreding. In the night he goes out to meet his friends in the Kronen, a bar. Every situation can be taken a little farther. There are no limits, no accepted barriers. And more each time, each adventure is chained to the next, as if it were a continuous night. A long description of people: grandfather, parents, sister, girlfriend, friends. And, among that, the obscure will of living every minute as if it were the last one. But something which happens puts Carlos and his friend against a reality they have been trying to ignore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f38fly9cxkE9x9dMb0xDdRIWCOI.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Diego Botto (Carlos)", "Jordi Moll\u00e0 (Roberto)", "Eduardo Noriega (Joven pelea 1.)", "Aitor Merino (Pedro)", "Armando del R\u00edo (Manolo)", "Diana G\u00e1lvez (Silvia)", "I\u00f1aki M\u00e9ndez (Miguel)", "Mercedes Sampietro (Madre de Carlos)", "Andr\u00e9 Falcon (Abuelo de Carlos)", "Josep Maria Pou (Padre de Carlos)", "Cayetana Guill\u00e9n Cuervo (Hermana de Carlos)", "Mary Gonz\u00e1lez (T\u00eda de Carlos)", "N\u00faria Prims (Amalia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [264735, 80133, 116314, 79068], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
