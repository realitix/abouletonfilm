His estranged son never matched up to his expectations anyway, he is still eaten up with jealousy of his brother, who always enjoys life to the full, and - above all - he cannot keep up with the changes around him. He buys himself a plot in a graveyard with an beautiful view of the Alps and checks into a retirement home so he can wait for his death in peace.
