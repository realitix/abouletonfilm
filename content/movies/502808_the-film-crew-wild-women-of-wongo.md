Might Mother Nature fix this by creating a tribe on a nearby island where all the men are hunks, and the women are brutes? You\u2019d think not, but the makers of Wild Women of Wongo are not you. Wild Women of Wongo is a sex farce without the sex or the farce, set in a never-never land of uncivilized island dwellers who all look like someone going to a Halloween party as \u201cuncivilized island dweller.\u201d  Add a crocodile who comes in the form of stock footage and rubber model, a lot of awkward dancing, and an actress named \u201cAdrienne Bourbeau\u201d who refuses to actually be Adrienne Barbeau, and you got yourself a movie. Mike, Kevin and Bill will DANCE their way into your hearts with this riff.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xWYJAc4GD2WVnKqffAh9ZKEnLtG.jpg", "actors": ["Michael J.
