It's theme of a singing guided tour of the lot (and some of the footage) is from 1944's \"Musical Movieland\", the former title holder, and it contains clips from 1939's \"Quiet, Please\" and \"Royal Rodeo\"; \"Sunday Roundup\" from 1936 and 1940's \"The Singing Dude.\" Pieces from \"Out Where the Stars Begin\" and \"Swingtime in the Movies\" may also be used, but it's hard to tell since they all tend to run together and show up in a lot of places during the 1940's Warner shorts. Its title of \"Movieland Magic\" is most apt considering the sleight-of-hand performed by the WB Shorts and Sales departments in once again selling the same film clips for the 3rd, 4th or more times.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yt88rhp1Tw4f6e5rN6EFSxrn71c.jpg", "actors": ["Scotty Beckett ()", "Lucile Fairbanks ()", "Fritz Feld ()", "Dick Foran ()", "Kathryn Kane ()", "Jane Wyman ()", "Fuzzy Knight ()", "John Payne ()", "Anne Shirley ()", "Mel Torm\u00e9 ()", "Leo White ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
