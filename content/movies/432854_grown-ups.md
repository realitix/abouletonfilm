It centers on a family dominated by the smothering, sanctimonious love of Helen, the mother of our middle-aged hero Jake.  Played by All in the Family's Jean Stapleton, she is a masterpiece of malignant maternity while her husband, played by Martin Balsam, cushions himself with stiff drinks and asks everyone, \"So what's new?\"  Charles Grodin plays the long-suffering son and Marilu Henner of Taxi is his uneasy wife.  The combination of play and cast is irresistible.  Spicy and sharp, Grown Ups is a comic feast.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Martin Balsam (Jack)", "Marilu Henner (Louise)", "Charles Grodin (Jake)", "Jean Stapleton (Helen)", "Kerry Segal (Edie)", "Paddy Campanaro (Marilyn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
