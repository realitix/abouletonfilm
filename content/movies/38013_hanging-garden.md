Kuchu Teien is, on the face of it, more a drama, a character study, than a typical Toyoda genre flick. Yet within this beautifully structured and photographed film, there lies a dark soul. Ostensibly the story of a happy family, it becomes increasingly clear as the movie progresses that the Kyobashis are anything but. Despite a family agreement that they are all open with each other, the entire household knows the opposite is true.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d5ndICbodqU8wo92F8LjBbb8Rdu.jpg", "actors": ["Kyoko Koizumi (Eriko Kyobashi)", "Anne Suzuki (Mana Kyobashi)", "Itsuji Itao (Takashi Kyobashi)", "Masahiro Hirota (Ko Kyobashi)", "Jun Kunimura (Eriko's brother)", "Eita (Tezuka)", "Asami Imajuku (Sacchin)", "Ryo Katsuji (Morisaki)", "Sonim (Mina)", "Hiromi Nagasaku (Asako Iizuka)", "Michiyo Ookusu (Satoko Kinosaki)", "Kiyohiko Shibukawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [228941, 25063, 69454, 146678], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
