Then, we go to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial where we see and hear the Band play \"Aura Lee,\" \"Pack Up Your Troubles,\" and \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary.\" Band members also sing the latter songs, but \"Love Me Tender\" isn't a number one song yet, so \"Aura Lee\" just gets a musical treatment. The film concludes with \"Over There,\" played and sung, as we see news footage of the Army rolling in to Paris.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yWWiNqCYucFjlvgsE4QmQQ4wvZ2.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas F.
