Despite this, we see the life of the community in all its joys and sorrows, of those that live there while others decide to leave for a better life north. For those remaining, things come to a serious situation when one prominent businessman is being muscled out by a white competitor using racist intimidation. In response, the community must make the decision of whether to submit meekly like they always have, or finally fight for their rights.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tsJSlkFSZPQhhVuKrYJXNClYaPD.jpg", "actors": ["Al Freeman, Jr. (Poppa)", "Phylicia Rash\u0101d (Ma Ponk)", "Paula Kelly (Ma Pearl)", "Salli Richardson-Whitfield (Miss Alice (as Salli Richardson))", "Anna Maria Horsford (Miss Annie)", "Bernie Casey (Mr. Walter)", "Isaac Hayes (Preacher Hurn)", "Ray J (Cliff (12 Yrs.)
