My teacher taught me all these things about evolution and eventually, I accepted them. Then in June, I saw the YouTube video of \u201c100 Reasons Why Evolution is SO Stupid!\u201d I watched that and realized that nearly everything my teacher had taught me was disproved lies. It was so entertaining as well as informative and educational, that I stayed up nearly all night watching more videos. You got me to realize that Genesis is true! I can EVER repay you for saving me! When we see each other in Heaven, I will be standing along with the hundreds of thousands of people you won to Christ! I myself have already won a friend to Christ with your material! I want to save more people. God bless you!\u2013Eric June 2013", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a77WQeMyaK8pjGZ5ZkUuOK5fQ5J.jpg", "actors": ["Dr. Kent Hovind (Speaker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
