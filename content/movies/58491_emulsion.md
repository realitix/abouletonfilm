Painting a murky film noir world where no one is exactly as they appear, Emulsion follows Dane Allen as he evolves from an utterly forgettable cog into a potent activist who brings the powers that be to their knees. It is a story of discovery, manipulation and the never-ending struggle between complacency and self-actualization.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tIapB4Kd4eizjXpJuAtBxv5Q9cr.jpg", "actors": ["Claudia Bassols (Isabella Maze)", "Sam Heughan (Ronny Maze)", "Lex Shrapnel (Billy Patterson)", "Mehmet Ferda (Egor)", "David Ajala (Jeff)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
