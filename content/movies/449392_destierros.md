It is of little matter where these migrants come from, as it is, above all, a matter of staying alive and avoiding the gangs that keep an eye on the long path to exile. However, everyone knows the goal: to get into the north of the continent, the United States or Canada, at all costs, aboard goods trains, which they hang onto dangerously. In complete immersion, Hubert Caron-Guay filmed this last chance voyage in which waiting contends with anguish, even though solidarity is tangible at times, like in the sequence where a man enjoins his companions in misfortune to \u201crun at the same speed as the train\u201d, otherwise, death is certain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j9OykUins2FQCC70ESAhxd0FxgE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
