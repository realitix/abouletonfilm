The other three are convinced that Sing stole the goods for himself, so Sing decides to hide out with his kick-butt cousin Kuen, played with athletic aplomb by kung-fu princess Kara Hui! But some insurance investigators (Carina Lau and Billy Lau) are also after the loot, and there's even a mousy travel agent (future director Clarence Fok) thrown in for good measure. It all adds up to numerous shenanigans and action-comedy hijinks, culminating in a knockdown action finale set in a warehouse! Wooden crates, two-by-fours, and more props than you can name are used and abused in the name of creative eighties HK-style action, which Jackie Chan and company are only too glad to dispense to the audience!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s52ptQNLDBZ3AoxXwOBjAT9VT2t.jpg", "actors": ["Kara Hui (Ah Chuan)", "Carina Lau (Bonnie)", "Mars (Sheng)", "Clarence Yiu-leung Fok (Ah Liang)", "Billy Lau (Detective Ah Fu)", "Paul Chang Chung (Chen Chung-Pai / Chen Da Qian)", "Philip Ko (Ma Hui)", "Lo Meng (Huo Chiang)", "Tai Bo (Piao)", "Chu Tit-Wo (Chin Ta-Chi / Chin Ta Dou)", "Charlie Cho (Mr Chen's assistant)", "Tai San (Mr Chen's thug)", "Thomas Sin Ho-Ying (Mr Chen's thug)", "Stanley Fung (Detective)", "Lui Fong (Robber)", "Michael Lai Siu-Tin (Robber)", "Ricky Hui (Taxi driver)", "Fruit Chan (Travel agency's staff)", "Jackie Chan (Prisoner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
