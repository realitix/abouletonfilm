Neither does anyone else...and those who DO remember him wish they didn't. MORTAL REMAINS is a corker of an indie film, a documentary of sorts about the search for a filmmaker whose work was so troublesome that he has been all but eradicated from movie history. Convincing detail and believable performances lend the film an air of authenticity sorely lacking from many low-budget productions. The apocryphal stories surrounding Atticus and his work are recounted by people who worked with him and witnessed his descent into madness and the occult at firsthand. Could these grisly legends be true? Watch this film with your hand on the remote -- there are scores of little details you might miss on the first viewing. An excellent first effort from the up-and-coming indie studio Cryptic Pictures."}], "recommandations_id": [86328, 80720, 88410]}
