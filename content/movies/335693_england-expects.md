Newfound social responsibilities are trampled underfoot when Ray's racist past is revived amid tensions between Whites and Asians jostling for position on the council housing list. Among those who are wanting to be rehoused in a new development is Ray's alcoholic ex-wife Sadie (Camille Coduri), and his teenage daughter Nikki (Sadie Thompson). After a failed attempt to rehouse Sadie and Nikki, and soon discovering that Nikki is involved in heroin addiction, Ray's anger drives him to re-join a BNP organisation led by his old friend Larry Knowles (Keith Barron).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zty91aHS9mRrPMjMAn3GGxJfEvk.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Mackintosh ()", "Susan Vidler ()", "Keith Barron ()", "Camille Coduri ()", "Karl Johnson ()", "Preeya Kalidas ()", "Nitin Ganatra ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
