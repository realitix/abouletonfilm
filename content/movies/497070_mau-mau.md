Its object: the defeat of \"Mau Mau.\" In the war that followed, fewer than 40 of Kenya's 40,000 white settlers were killed while more than 15,000 Africans lost their lives, and hundreds of thousands more were arrested and subjected to a humiliating and often brutal process of \"rehabilitation.\" But what was Mau Mau? A movement based, according to the British Colonial Secretary, on a \"perverted nationalism and a sort of nostalgia for barbarism\"? Or the Land Freedom Army, an organized political and military response to repression and armed aggression? Using newsreel and previously inaccessible archive footage, and drawing on interviews with participants on both sides, Mau Mau examines the myth and the reality of Africa's first modern guerrilla war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/poY0gUOUkOUUkuDDzRf4gjLb9ga.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
