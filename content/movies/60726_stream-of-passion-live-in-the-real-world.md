The band performed seven of their own songs plus a fine collection of Arjen Lucassen\u00b4s Ayreon classics, like Computer Eyes, Valley of the Queens, The Castle Hall, a collection of Human Equation songs and many others. For the Ayreon material the band were supported by Damian Wilson, who originally appeared on many of the Ayreon albums.
