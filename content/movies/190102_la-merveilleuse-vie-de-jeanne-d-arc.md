The comparison is unfair: Dreyer was an artist, but director Marco de Gastyne certainly proved himself a distinguished craftsman, and his emphasis on the Maid of Orl\u00e9ans early life in Domr\u00e9my serves as a picturesque, matching bookend to Dreyer's impassioned courtroom drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6AHaTINItO9X2KvaKNYNhyP7ON9.jpg", "actors": ["Simone Genevois (Jeanne d'Arc)", "Fernand Mailly (La Hire)", "Georges Paulais (Nicolas Loyseleur)", "Jean Debucourt (Charles VII)", "Philippe H\u00e9riat (Gilles de Rays)", "Gaston Modot (Lord Glasdall)", "Daniel Mendaille (Lord Talbot)", "Jean-Louis Allibert ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Viguier ()", "Genica Athanasiou ()", "L\u00e9once Cargue ()", "Jean Dalbe ()", "Pierre Denols ()", "Choura Milena ()", "Mary Serta ()", "Jean-Pierre Stock ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
