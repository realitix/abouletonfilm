But the Powell mine deposits are diminishing. The Mesabi range represents a whole new productive area but the rights to mine there are held by a young geological engineer, Kyle Ramlo. The latter reaches an impasse when he needs money to continue his experimentation with open-pit mining and goes to Miss Powell for financing. She displays great interest in both his inventive mining method and in him personally but secretly plots to destroy him and take over his Masabi rights. The gullible Ramlo falls into clutches while the girl he really loves, Cathy Norlund, tries desperately to open his eyes to Christine's scheme.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i97z4wnc1wtb6gLvKZNNUkn1IU1.jpg", "actors": ["Rod Cameron (Kyle Ramlo)", "Ruth Hussey (Christine Powell)", "John Agar (David Powell)", "Gale Storm (Cathy Nordlund)", "J.
