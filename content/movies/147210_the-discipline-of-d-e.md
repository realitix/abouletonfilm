It\u2019s based on a story in \u201cExterminator!\u201d by William Burroughs that at times reads like Buddhist noir:  \"DE is a way of doing. DE simply means doing whatever you do in the easiest most relaxed way you can manage which is also the quickest and most efficient way, as you will find as you advance in DE.You can start right now tidying up your flat, moving furniture or books, washing dishes, making tea, sorting papers. Don't fumble, jerk, grab an object. Drop cool possessive fingers onto it like a gentle old cop making a soft arrest.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5sP1hX1DbMfnYpjCLwxJXQg6krc.jpg", "actors": ["David Worden (a young man)", "Frank Birney ()", "Ken Shapiro ()", "Tom Sherohman ()", "Irving Sicherman ()", "Doris Hess ()", "Michael L.
