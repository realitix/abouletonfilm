The creator - Professor Emilio Missiroli - wants to show that only a thousand breaking taboos' that stifle the sexual life can liberate man from his existential malaise. Every night, so, for a whole week, men and women of the group will couple through a draw, without giving any importance to their feelings, thus demonstrating that these can and should do without. Based on Wilhelm Reich's The Sexual Revolution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qCANqSbpzPpCKwRxL7HcTEASBVI.jpg", "actors": ["Christian Aligny (Cesare)", "Laura Antonelli (Stella)", "Maria Luisa Bavastro (Nanna)", "Andr\u00e9s Jos\u00e9 Cruz Soublette (Tony)", "Riccardo Cucciolla (Emilio Missiroli)", "Giulio Girola (Dino Segre)", "Lorenza Guerrieri (Rita)", "Guy Heron (Marco)", "Marisa Mantovani (Marcella Segre)", "Ruggero Miti (Giorgio Segre)", "Mar\u00eda Montero ()", "Rosa Bianca Scerrino ()", "Mar\u00eda Rosa Sclauzero ()", "Gaspare Zola ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
