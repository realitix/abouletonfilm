{"tmdb_id": 490891, "title": "King of the Ocean", "original_title": "King of the Ocean", "slug_title": "king-of-the-ocean", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "\"King of the Ocean\" is a film about a man named Neal who goes through a major shark attack. Neal's arm and leg are bitten off and he is placed into a carer's institution by a woman named Roses. Roses is not who she makes out to be; she is a vicious and evil lady who makes life hell for her Client. Neal goes through a cruel and awful ordeal that he never thought he would have to go through, especially after his brutal shark attack. Neal is sharing the home with another Client called Tim who helps Neal. They work together and finally manage to call for help. Finally, Roses is put away where she belongs. Weeks pass and Neal answers the door to a Lady named Rosie. This is a two part movie. The sequel to \"King of the Ocean\" is available on another DVD titled \"Rosie's Return.\" This film is very similar but different to my up and coming novel \"The Swim Inside my Nightmare\" which will be out soon. This is a no budget film shot on a Panasonic HC-MDH2 and is an independent production.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uQ2PveVqJaUnFl25imuZgQn2umN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
