While she should be taking care of her ten-year-old daughter and the household, her routine is falling apart and she is falling further into depression. Israel is just before the outbreak of the Six-Day War in 1967. The historical events echo in the lives of the characters only from a great distance. The female characters within the family wage a more important battle for their own identity. The director intentionally chose the parallel stories of three female protagonists: ten-year-old Michal who is just starting to acknowledge her sexuality, a single university student and Ruth, a trapped housewife.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ns6cMR4tQFObEsvtJSkoTqWVmRe.jpg", "actors": ["Reymonde Amsallem ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
