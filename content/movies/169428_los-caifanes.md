The rain and the searching for a most proper place for intimacy head them to a car apparently abandoned. After a little kissing in the car, the couple realizes that the car is actually owned by Captain Gato and his caifanes. This encounter starts a tour around Mexico City, encouraged by the fascination shown by Paloma and for the manners, the way of speech and the treatment of the lower classes as well as the spontaneous friendship (always under suspect) that Los Caifanes provides them. The rest of the film is a portrait of the night life in the mexican capital city in the tumultuous and psychedelic sixties. As the group goes to cabarets, parks, funeral homes, taverns and public squares, some customs of the time are shown, alternating with a wide range of artistic expressions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ouesdh6XcbKYrGrKxYAQrf4kq91.jpg", "actors": ["Julissa (Paloma)", "Enrique \u00c1lvarez F\u00e9lix (Jaime de Landa)", "Sergio Jim\u00e9nez (Capit\u00e1n Gato)", "\u00d3scar Ch\u00e1vez (El Estilos)", "Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz (El Azteca)", "Eduardo L\u00f3pez Rojas (El Mazacote)", "Tamara Garina (Old Prostitute)", "Martha Zabaleta (La Elota)", "Lety G\u00f3mez (Lupe 'Magda')", "Juli\u00e1n de Meriche (Man in Cabaret)", "Socorro Avelar (Cabaret Worker)", "Ren\u00e9 Barrera (Lottery Seller)", "Carlos Monsivais (Santa Claus)", "Ignacio Vallarta (Blind Man with Guitar)", "Evelia Cardenas (Cabaret Worker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [340373, 113029, 385114], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
