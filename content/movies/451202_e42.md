Originally designed as a monumental space for public performance and collective acts of solidarity to the Fascist regime, this landscape was in fact never inaugurated. After the war, the 420 acre area was recuperated and today projects a timeless aura of an unfinished and temporary, empty and silent, monumental and imposing as well as an ephemeral landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Sy9V5veAQ8KwlVzfUkOowmYPNq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
