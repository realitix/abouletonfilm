This film analyses Aalto\u2019s uniquely successful resolution of the demands and possibilities created by new technology and construction materials with the need to make his buildings sympathetic both to their users and to their natural surroundings. His inventive use of timber in particular represents both a reference to the forest landscape of Finland and a building material that is \u2018warm\u2019 and extremely adaptable. Filmed in Finland, Italy, Germany and the USA, this documentary shows how the Finnish natural environment and art traditions were essential elements in Aalto\u2019s pioneering harmonization of technology and nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vGLVt39fwjImpcKTv48VnchM2A7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
