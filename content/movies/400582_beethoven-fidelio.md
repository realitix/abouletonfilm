Singers are generally well chosen and perform admirably. However, at this point, slight reservations creep in; although Janowitz (Fidelio/Leonore) and Kollo (Florestan) look \"good\" and act well, the singing parts tax them a bit when pushed to the limit. Most of the time that doesn't matter, and an argument can be made that a little vocal strain is in character with their dire plight. Ideally, for me, Vickers as Florestan would have added extra vocal heft and more sensitive acting than Kollo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9E21n9v6UF7r8Mq3MbNQXg7fiGt.jpg", "actors": ["Gundula Janowitz (Leonora)", "Ren\u00e9 Kollo (Florestan)", "Manfred Jungwirth (Rocco)", "Hermann Hans Sotin (Don Pizarro)", "Lucia Popp (Marzelline)", "Adolf Dallapozza (Jaquino)", "Hans Helm (Fernando)", "Karl Terkal (1er Gefangener)", "Alfred \u0160ramek (2e Gefangener)", "Leonard Bernstein (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
