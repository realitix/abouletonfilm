These animals, although they've got the hint of their natural instinct left, are unlikely to survive if released back to the wild. It'd be difficult for them to take part in the pack and they lack the skills to find food. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal for everyone at the zoo is to send the animals back to where they truly belong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wtT1L63TD14Qdqq8TvT5DWldElt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
