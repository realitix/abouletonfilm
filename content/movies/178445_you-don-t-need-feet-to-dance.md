Sidiki struggles to cope with his disability and to earn a decent living, but he still manages to teach workshops for disabled kids, busk on the street, rehearse with his musical group, bicycle with his hands, and prepare for a baby naming ceremony, where he plays djembe drums, sings, and dances on his hands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JTVsAlG6wWT781SduGm2DUG2eJ.jpg", "actors": ["Sidiki Conde (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
