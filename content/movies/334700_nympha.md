The movie as a whole is an exposition of the events in Nympha\u2019s life that lead to this scene. Nympha is a young girl reared and morally sheltered by a hypocritically pious elder female relative. The girl\u2019s blind piety, however, is ripped apart by her sudden awareness of the sexually-charged environment and by her own first love affair. Eventually, she goes from man to man, driven by her demonic desires. Her unwanted pregnancy finally leads to a gory, fatal abortion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ctOcuxYSqvoB8WDe0zIWkAaw4hU.jpg", "actors": ["Rizza ()", "Philip Gamboa ()", "Bella Flores ()", "Romy Diaz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
