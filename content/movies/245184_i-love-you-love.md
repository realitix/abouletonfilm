Pi\u0161ta is an unmarried man who works at a freight wagon which carries letters and parcels. Alcohol helps him to overcome his handicap of being short and not good-looking. He wishes he had a woman, but the woman he really wants, ageing Viera who reloads the cargoes, has a soft spot for another man. So, Pi\u0161ta has nobody and nothing, except for senile mother who sometimes fails to recognize him. The film received Silver Bear for Best Director at the International Film Festival in Berlin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oC23VjKqip1cmvFGypPHV22Gl7A.jpg", "actors": ["Roman K\u0142osowski (Vinco)", "Iva Jan\u017eurov\u00e1 (Viera)", "Milan Jeli\u0107 (Pista)", "Milada Jezkov\u00e1 (Mother)", "V\u00e1clav Babka (Alb\u00edn)", "Marie Motlov\u00e1 (Sida)", "\u013dudov\u00edt Reiter ()", "Juraj Nvota (Jaro)", "Ivan Pal\u00fach (Rudo)", "Vera B\u00edl\u00e1 (Berta (as B\u00edl\u00e1 Viera))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
