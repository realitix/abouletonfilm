It was attended by 120,000 people. The concert consisted of two parts, the Main Concert and a Sunrise Concert. The concert cost approximately $9,500,000 and it originated when Jean-Michel Jarre was contacted by the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak with a special project to celebrate the dawn of the new Millennium at the foot of the only remaining monument of the original 7 Wonders of the World - the Great Pyramids.  Jarre's team had developed giant projections to be displayed on the faces of the Great Pyramids, however a heavy cloud of fog made the pyramids almost invisible, so most of the projections were discarded. Parts of the concert were broadcast live on TV stations around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r4AJlyBBX3Es8OuPB8Gk5Ih9Kjc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4SJs9LYkXCg"}
