{"tmdb_id": 44942, "title": "Blues Masters", "original_title": "Blues Masters", "slug_title": "blues-masters", "date": "1999-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "In 1966, CBC Television invited some of North America's greatest blues performers to gather in a studio in Toronto, recording together and individually in sessions that lasted three days. The result was originally televised as part of the CBC \"Festival\" series, and now the session video tapes have been found, restored and re-edited. The great Muddy Waters and his band perform \"You Can't Lose What You Never Had\" and \"Got My Mojo Workin',\" the latter with James Cotton on harmonica. Willie Dixon goes solo on \"Bassology\" and (helped by a little '90s technology) performs \"Crazy for My Baby\" with host Colin James. Plus rare appearances by Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Mable Hillery singing \"How Long This Train Been Gone,\" and delta blues piano player Sunnyland Slim, introducing a whole new generation to this inspiring, soulful music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vqOeW6A1kpjRTXYqyCwQaLxJ6Pi.jpg", "actors": ["Muddy Waters ()", "B.B.
