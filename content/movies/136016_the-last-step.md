Her improper behavior is a reaction to the recent death of her husband Koshrow, who accidentally fell down a flight of stairs. And it is Koshrow who serves as the film\u2019s somewhat unreliable narrator, appearing in the movie even after his death. The couple\u2019s complicated yet loving relationship unfolds as a delicately ironic detective story inside the elusive and, at the same time, obsessively arranged space- time of memory. Nevertheless, it reveals Koshrow\u2019s secret life crisis and delves deep into the past, to an ancient house in the mountains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zyQbOy7xkr5ocJAtihawjCTKQRQ.jpg", "actors": ["Leila Hatami (Leila)", "Ali Mosaffa (Koshrow)", "Alireza Aghakhani ()", "Hamed Behdad ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ewjMWohjNe4"}
