Adrie and Francien\u2019s greengrocer\u2019s shop in Flushing\u2019s old town has been there for 65 years. Old age has affected their walking ability, but Adrie still works 14 to 16 hours a day. Just before they got married in 1957, they went on holiday for the first and last time. Since then they haven\u2019t got around to it. Working hard is their creed. Ada, Adrie\u2019s much younger sister, helps out in the shop every day. She worries at the prospect of spending three months in the south of France.
