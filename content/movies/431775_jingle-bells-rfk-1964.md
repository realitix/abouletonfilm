But it\u2019s the films\u2019 fleeting, in-between, moments where Pennebaker most precisely hits the mark, offering reflection on the possibilities that Robert Kennedy\u2019s all too brief life foreclosed. Set against the pageantry of a long ago Christmas, the film speaks to tragic contingencies of history lying far beyond the ken of politics that continue to circumscribe the tortured destiny of our country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kLae0lEiri7uRVnUdhegYKxlhes.jpg", "actors": ["Robert F.
