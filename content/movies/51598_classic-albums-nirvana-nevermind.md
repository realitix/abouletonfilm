With unprecedented openness, remaining band members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl discuss the production of individual songs, and tell amusing anecdotes about the band's financial struggles just before making it big. In addition, NEVERMIND producer Butch Vig invites viewers into his studio, where he dissects and examines each of the album's tracks. By isolating, examining, and reassembling each instrument and vocal track, Vig is able to recreate the manner in which the album was produced.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1PGNqqgD5nKSJcpdN5J5B6OzDDn.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Grohl (Himself)", "Krist Novoselic (Himself)", "Butch Vig (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37756, 32742, 13070, 32835], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
