Having been scarred by inappropriate contact by an adult as a young girl; she has a hard time distinguishing between right and wrong behavior with young men. Her overbearing mother has driven Ja-young to the point where she can no longer act on her own will and this leads to trouble for her. There is a theme of men fondling and caressing women's knees in the film which is the focal point of all male sexual advances towards Ja-Young. Things spiral out of control for not only Ja-Young but her family who has their fair share of issues and skeletens in the closet. We tend to see this film as addressing some of the modern issues that affect the lives of young Koreans in the 1980's.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/348XSn99otiRdRjuXHFOxr7jCvm.jpg", "actors": ["Ahn Sung-ki ()", "Lee Bo-hee ()", "Lee Hye-young ()", "Seong-min Lim ()", "Na Han-il ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
