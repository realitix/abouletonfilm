In the story, the schoolgirl Alexandra's father was a celebrated partisan who fought against the Nazis in World War Two. His prominence must have been considered a threat, because at the beginning of this film, he denounced and arrested. Not only that, but Alexandra (Monika Budjonova) has her cherished Young Pioneer (communist youth league) membership stripped from her. Her teachers have been forced to publicly humiliate her for being the daughter of an enemy of the state, and her friends, except for the inexplicably loyal Ivan (Kliment Corbadziev) have had to abandon her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uH8Qt7trnZXUgRXN7Mfnimgkioo.jpg", "actors": ["Kliment Chorbadzhiev (Ivan)", "Simeon Savov (Moni)", "Monika Budyonova (Aleksandra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
