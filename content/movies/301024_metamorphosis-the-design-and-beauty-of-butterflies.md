In Metamorphosis you will explore their remarkable world as few ever have before.  Spectacular photography, computer animation and magnetic resonance imaging open once hidden doors to every stage of a butterfly's life-cycle. From an egg the size of a pinhead to a magnificent flying insect. It is a transformation so incredible biologists have called it \"butterfly magic.\"  How did these extraordinary creatures come into being? Are they the products of a blind, undirected process? Or were they designed by an intelligent cause?  Filmed in North, Central, and South America, Metamorphosis is an unforgettable documentary filled with the joys of discovery and wonder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ykk6sAYpkpm1fXJvgwImy8TEixj.jpg", "actors": ["Alvin Chea ()", "Paul Nelson ()", "Thomas Emmel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AZk6nZGH9Xo"}
