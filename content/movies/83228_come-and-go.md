Jo\u00e3o Vuvu is not vet sociable, if at all, and every day takes a trip on bus number 100, untiringly repeating the same route: going up from Pra\u00e7a das Flores to the Pr\u00edncipe Real garden and going down to his starting point and subsequent return home. Only a few occasional incidents may episodically alter this daily routine that seems to correspond to the protagonist's desire for isolation, to his assuming of an exile that makes him relapse into a social intercourse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ajIGaSdcnOJGiVnPs2gYp0RHxNV.jpg", "actors": ["Jo\u00e3o C\u00e9sar Monteiro (Jo\u00e3o Vuvu)", "Rita Pereira Marques (Adriana / Urraca)", "Joaquina Chicau (Cust\u00f3dia)", "Manuela de Freitas (Fausta)", "L\u00edgia Soares (Narcisa the Antigona)", "Jos\u00e9 Mora Ramos (Senhor Z\u00e9 Aniceto)", "Rita Dur\u00e3o (Jacinta)", "Maria Do Carmo R\u00f4lo (B\u00e1rbara the Policewoman)", "Miguel Borges (Jorge Varela Vuvu)", "Rita Loureiro (Marina)", "Ana Isabel Strindberg (Zulmira)", "Tiago Diaz (Mi\u00fado do Acorde\u00e3o - boy accordionist)", "Ana Brand\u00e3o (Eva Sigar)", "Rui Lu\u00eds (Padre - priest)", "V\u00edtor Silva Tavares (Man at the Funeral)", "M\u00e1rio Barroso (M\u00e9dico)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
