She is the daughter of a white man who died in a shipwreck and of a black laundress of African origin.

The captain also fell in love with Caridad and proposes that they live together and she accepts. Caridad works in a cabaret in the port and the owner, Guevara (Ren\u00e9 Cardona), feels an attraction for the girl, and in a moment of jealousy, tries to kill Martin.
