They used to run a family hotel in the belgian countryside. Dominique, Ludovic and Louis, his 3 children, are keen to sell the hotel and start new lives, far away from the memory of their mother. Without facing up to or sharing their father\u2019s grief, they take matters in hand. But the arrival of Alice, a young woman who\u2019s 8 months\u2019 pregnant, turns their plans upside down.
