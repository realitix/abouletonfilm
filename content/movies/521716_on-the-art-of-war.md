Four workers climb a 20 meters high gantry crane inside the hangar of the INNSE, the last active factory in Milan. They threaten to throw themselves down to stop the dismantling of the machineries and the closure of the factory they work in. The hangar is surrounded by dozens of policemen and supporters from all over Italy. It is not a simple struggle. They have a clear strategy. They have an organized army. They know perfectly their territory and their enemy. There are clear rules, it is a war with a workable paradigm for all forms of struggle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j1T5NOXHwOQaqHdVIadn8ZNOqJP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
