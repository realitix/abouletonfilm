He promises to his mother that he will begin a new and honest life. He finds new meaning in taking care of his daughter Smilja. He tries to chase away destructive thoughts that threaten to overwhelm him by throwing himself into hard work. However, everything around him reminds him of his past and his family's tragic destiny. His family was wealthy at the beginning of the twentieth century, but was destroyed by the capitalist powers that took over the villages and broke the traditional family cooperatives. Djuka's personal life was marked by constant conflicts with his father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Vo3nLiiAts8i5urmZ5R1kcZFtL.jpg", "actors": ["Slobodan \u0106usti\u0107 (\u0110uka Begovi\u0107)", "Fabijan Sovagovic (Sima)", "Asja Jovanovi\u0107 (Ljubica)", "Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107 (Ilja)", "Ur\u0161ka Hlebec (Jagoda)", "Krunoslav Sen\u010di\u0107 (\u0110uka kao dje\u010dak)", "Zaim Muzaferija (Ilarija Begovi\u0107)", "Perica Martinovi\u0107 (Ru\u017ea)", "Nata\u0161a Ti\u010d Ralijan (Smilja)", "Mustafa Nadarevi\u0107 (Mata)", "Helena Buljan (Mara)", "Zoran Pokupec (Roth)", "\u017deljko Vukmirica (Andra)", "Stjepan Bahert (\u017dupnik)", "Milan Jovanovi\u0107 (Gli\u0161o)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
