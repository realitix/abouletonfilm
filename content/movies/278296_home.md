After her husband's death, elderly Frida comes to know her introverted, friendless adult granddaughter, Lou, from whom she had long been kept apart by Frida's estranged daughter. Frida invites another misfit into her household: 10-year-old Tom, who welcomes the chance to spend time away from both his home and his bullying classmates. Meanwhile, Lou reluctantly gets drawn into a friendship with secondhand bookseller Henrik. A dry comedy of great charm and warmth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1V0BQnu7U6CTqVfzktZJgNiQ9jq.jpg", "actors": ["Moa Gammel (Lou)", "Simon J.
