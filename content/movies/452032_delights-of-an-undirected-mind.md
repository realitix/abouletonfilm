The girl moves according to the distended time of dreams procuring pastel pal after another. It suggests that the subconscious craves the kind of chaos that apparently only barbotine sex can provide. In these Delights of an Undirected Mind (2016,) a giraffe soon sits atop a petrified fox like a Hag or succubus making haunted advances, whilst dearest My Little Pony is groomed with an increasingly lewd touch. As a Wolf in Grandma\u2019s clothing feeds the troupe milk from a nippled bottle\u2014think Little Red Riding Ho\u2019\u2014both the film and the milk condense the quiet purity of babyish slumber into an eddying fantasy.
