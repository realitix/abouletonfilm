With Eric Clapton on guitar, Joe Sample of The Crusaders on keyboards, virtuoso saxophone player David Sanborn and super session players Steve Gadd on drums and Marcus Miller on bass, the group's pedigree is extraordinary. They never made an album and this concert at Montreux is the only record of their stunning collaboration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rmTRE4hDyngmHn7LLcnoDbwlvvf.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Clapton (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
