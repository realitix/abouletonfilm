They create experimental cyborgs in an attempt to take over the world. Eventually, Hongo is turned into a cyborg \u2014 Masked Rider 1 \u2014 but soon regains his self-awareness. Realizing that he is now controlled by evil, Hongo escapes. Shocker views Hongo as a traitor and dispatches a new, nearly identical cyborg \u2014 Masked Rider 2 \u2014 to destroy him. But they're too evenly matched and their duel ends in a draw. Growing impatient, Shocker sends two new cyborgs \u2014 Snake and Cobra \u2014 to kill them both. KAMEN RIDER THE FIRST is a new adaptation of the popular original manga created by Shotaro Ishinomori.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wgWZbKBUkkM6KOj6ZbkmrnWYHSh.jpg", "actors": ["Masaya Kikawada (Kamen Rider 1/Takeshi Hongo)", "Hassei Takano (Kamen Rider 2/Ichimonji Hayato)", "Rena Komine (Asuka Midorikawa)", "Hiroshi Miyauchi (Tobei Tachibana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36678, 24060, 21153, 41105], "youtube_key": "c0niSUpqbLI"}
