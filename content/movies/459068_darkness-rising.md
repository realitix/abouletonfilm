But it sucks. It sucks a lot, and as much as I've got an affection for Katrina Law after spending so much time with her in _Spartacus_ and _Arrow_, she is not a great actress, not in general and not in this, and she's still the best actor of the bunch. There might have been a solid idea here once, and there's obviously some talented people working somewhere behind the scenes, but even if you're a diehard horror fan, you can skip _Darkness Rising_ altogether.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [446360, 399372, 103071, 470614], "youtube_key": "XXuLx-kYC1E"}
