As in earlier series entries, the rangers are played by Jim Newill (the handsome one), Dave O'Brien (the athletic one) and Guy \"Panhandle\" Wilkerson (the funny one). The villain is the appropriately named Henry Black (Jack Ingram), guardian of the young heir to a gold mine. Since Black was responsible for orphaning said heir, he has no reservations about knocking off the kid as well-but the Texas Rangers aren't about to let that happen. Better photographed than most PRC westerns, Gunsmoke Mesa was lensed by the prolific and efficient Ira H. Morgan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7jyHDmz10z9ocis5LXj0CDl3wO8.jpg", "actors": ["James Newill (Jim Steele (as Jim Newill))", "Dave O'Brien (Tex Wyatt (as Dave 'Tex' O'Brien))", "Guy Wilkerson (Panhandle Perkins)", "Patti McCarty (Joan Royal)", "Jack Ingram (Henry Black)", "Kermit Maynard (Henchman Sneed)", "Robert Barron (Moore)", "Richard Alexander (Henchman Lear (as Dick Alexander))", "Michael Vallon (Judge Plymouth)", "Roy Brent (Deputy Mace)", "Jack Rockwell (Sheriff Horner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
