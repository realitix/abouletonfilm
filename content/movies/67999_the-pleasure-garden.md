The conservative views of the townspeople are shaken when they find out that the school teacher Franz\u00e9n published his own poetry anonymously many years ago. At the same time he acknowledges his love affair with a waitress at the city hotel, Fanny. What is most upsetting is the fact that Fanny has a grownup daughter, Anna, with no known father.
