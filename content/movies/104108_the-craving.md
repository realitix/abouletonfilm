The hermit is the least of their problems, however, as an unknown creature of the night lurks in the area.\r\n\r\nI've been watching a lot of barely-a-budget independent horror flicks lately, many with the identical plot as this one (e.g. \"Delirium\" & \"Feeding Grounds\"), and \"The Craving\" is noticeably professional by comparison. Despite a couple cases of dubious photography, the filmmaking is adept enough to pass for a theatrical release, at least a drive-in release. All the major components of filmmaking are proficient: cinematography, cast, acting, script, editing, gore effects, creature effects, etc.\r\n\r\nNo-budget horror flicks usually have sub-par women and actors in general, but the first act showcases Lesley Paterson as Jeannie and she's Prime A all the way. I'm not referring to the dark-haired girl, Diane, who has a top-nude sequence right out of the gate and who's decidedly average by comparison, although she has a striking face, as shown in the closing shot.\r\n\r\nThe low ratings and reviews for \"The Craving\" are inexplicable because it delivers the goods for what it is in all the requisite areas noted above. Moreover, the end credits\u2019 instrumental is atmospheric and moving.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 99 minutes and was shot in Desert Center, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": []}
