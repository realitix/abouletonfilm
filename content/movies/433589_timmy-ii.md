To avoid being discriminated against for being a robot, and to undermine his father who created him, he undergoes cosmetic surgery that results in him acquiring a human, but middle eastern looking head. Then 9/11 happens. In order to flee discrimination in a post-9/11 world, he escapes to the middle east where he finally fits in somewhere. He is eventually thrown into prison by a despotic dictator who suspects him of being a spy. Eventually he arrives home to reconcile with his father and accept his dual identity as part human and part robot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d88Esnktmg7fJM71phbvOCfJ0il.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
