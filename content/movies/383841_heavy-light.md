The pictures and the electronic score are unified in a strict structure made of three main sections which progressively develop three subsections. This film may look like it was made using computers or video to the uninitiated, but only animation and much optical printing are to be seen herein.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sJ4mZETh83z5P6DZaMX1nXwU1WC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [162691, 146670, 147819, 164127], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
