He comes to police attention through normal procedures (he was the victim's client), but his outbursts make him the prime suspect of the clever Porfiry. Meanwhile, life swirls around Raskolnikov: his mother and sister come to the city followed by two older men seeking his sister's hand; he meets a drunken clerk who is then killed in a traffic accident, and he falls in love with the man's daughter, Sonia, a young prostitute. She urges him to confess, promising to follow him to Siberia. Will he accept responsibility?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zC7jTt88tBiHBMWsIN4kWxXw8jG.jpg", "actors": ["Georgi Taratorkin (Raskolnikov)", "Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy (Porfiry Petrovitch)", "Viktoriya Fyodorova (Avdotya Romanovna)", "Yevgeni Lebedev (Marmeladov)", "Vladimir Basov (Luzhin)", "Lyubov Sokolova (Yelizaveta Ivanovna)", "Efim Kopelyan (Svidrigailov)", "Tatyana Bedova (Sonya Marmeladova)", "Inna Makarova (Nastasya)", "Valeriy Nosik (Zametov)", "Yuri Medvedev (Lebeziatnikov)", "Yevgeni Lazarev (Zosimov)", "Sergey Nikonenko ()", "Ivan Ryzhov (\u0422\u0438\u0442 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 (\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0439))", "Yakov Naishuler (\u044d\u043f\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0434 (\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445))", "Vladimir Vasiliev (Sharmanshchik)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [11809, 62692], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
