The Videos", "slug_title": "erasure-hits-the-videos", "date": "2003-09-09", "genre": ["Musique"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Erasure--Hits: The Videos plays in Dolby stereo, with some of the later videos being 16:9 format. Disc 2 includes exclusive performance footage, rare videos and tracks performed live on all of Erasure's major tours. Six lengthy promotional documentaries from 2001 to 2003 are included, which feature interviews with the pair. Hidden bonus footage has also been crammed on to the disc. The only downside is the clumsy menus, which are difficult to navigate and are not all that pleasing to the eye. --John Galilee", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zHhVSJq3BV6B1x60l620kPzrVPo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
