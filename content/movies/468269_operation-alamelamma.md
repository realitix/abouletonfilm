The money was, in fact, ransom money demanded by kidnappers from a wealthy businessman in exchange for his school-going son, John. Purmy clumsily attempts to prove his innocence and that he has nothing to do with the kidnapping, but is, obviously, on the police's radar. With the ongoing investigation, a number of twists and turns make the police suspect everyone, including their own kin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aZeeBwiPluh1dZM5fuZs1V7cTGa.jpg", "actors": ["Manish Rishi (Purmy)", "Shraddha Srinath (Ananya)", "Rajesh Nataranga (Police Inspector)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_5CcksSThA4"}
