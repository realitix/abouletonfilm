However, a few interruptions, including thinking for a moment that he sees a woman's body in his bed, having his car key not work, and thinking he hears his mother calling, delay his departure from home by almost a minute. When tragedy strikes close by, John revisits the morning's events. A phone call from his brother in Chicago confirms how odd this morning is. Did John experience telepathy or was it all coincidence? If radio waves can carry a communication, why not a mother's love?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b4qPFwo0llR7rl8W57y3I6C2435.jpg", "actors": ["Carey Wilson (Narrator (voice))", "William Henry (John Dough (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
