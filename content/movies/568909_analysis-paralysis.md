The problem is that, unchecked, the condition will lead Tyler into a state of complete inaction. To confront the disorder, Tyler decides to fight through his anxiety and ask his cute neighbor, Shane, out for coffee. Despite a flurry of imagined disasters, the date goes well, and Shane and Tyler ultimately become involved. Against all odds, the relationship moves forward, but not without every step of the way - sex, moving in together, and meeting Shane's parents - preceded by an avalanche of negative, albeit hilarious, fantasies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fp45aZzdSLdbvAvHO9n2gEuNcGC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
