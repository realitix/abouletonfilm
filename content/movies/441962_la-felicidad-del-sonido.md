What we hear is a vibration in the air, a vibration no one sees. Sound is invisible, but it drives us; it makes us cry, laugh, remember and dance; it rattles our insides, it moves us. Through a series of outlandish characters, the documentary takes the viewer on a voyage of the senses, as it reflects on nature, communal life, solitude and silence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/smky45VjoG8JBFsuenvJADUomlv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
