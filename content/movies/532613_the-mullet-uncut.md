The Mullet Uncut delves into the shady world of the mullet and exposes these people for what they really are ...mullets. A cross country trip with filmmakers Mark Maiocco and Michael Reinwald take you into the bizzare world of mullet hunting. You'll meet former mullets pro mullets, anti mullets and mullets.
