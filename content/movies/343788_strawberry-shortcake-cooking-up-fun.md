Strawberry and the gang decide to make some delightful desserts, and Apple Dumplin' wants to help - even though she's too little! But, when Apple falls asleep and dreams she's the oldest, and everyone else is a baby, she realizes there's really no rush to grow up! And Honey Pie Poney has a great idea - why don't Strawberry and the others create their own TV cooking show?
