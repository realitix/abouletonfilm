Jasmine's mother is rarely mentioned, and she is presumed to be dead. In the first film, Jasmine has become frustrated with the duties of being a princess, and longs for a life outside of the palace. This clashes with the fact that, according to the law, Jasmine must marry before her next birthday, which results in a problem because Jasmine wishes to marry for love rather than for wealth, glory and power. Jasmine is an official member of the Disney Princess franchise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jTH0x0RntUD0e0P89eMKXTpOf4k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
