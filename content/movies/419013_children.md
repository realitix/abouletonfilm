Even this brief film takes its departure from the sequencing of a book that is animated but ends with inanimate images. A reflection on a daughter of the assassinated President of the United States and on another little girl: naked and dead, on a heap of peasants murdered on a country road. On the one hand, a life of privilege in a great mansion taken by a great photographer, on the other, death in the dust, taken by a war photographer.\" Paolo Gioli", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Ra7fwckJmgCCJNowADv5FHz2CO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
