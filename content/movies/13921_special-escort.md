Of that group, we meet policeman Gy, in hot water with his insurance company and enduring the vicissitudes of an on-again, off-again romance with comely Daphne; twentysomething Lasse, who lives with his mom and is pathetically henpecked by her; Giselher, a chronically unemployed former manager; Frank, a philologist who spends his days as a house husband; and Olli, a deli proprietor whose business is rapidly going under. These five conjure up the wild idea of charging for liaisons with emotionally needy women, but the scheme doesn't exactly go as planned - as none can even begin to anticipate the eccentricities or oddities of the female clients who turn up in response to their offer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b1tFqlBa7QKxZvdlsCCLzkQ5Qa1.jpg", "actors": ["Florian Lukas (Frank)", "Gustav-Peter W\u00f6hler (Olli)", "Sebastian Bezzel (Gy)", "Kostja Ullmann (Lasse)", "Herbert Knaup (Giselher)", "Lisa Potthoff (Daphne)", "Nina Kronj\u00e4ger (Birte)", "Adriana Altaras (Ulrike)", "Simon Verhoeven (Wick)", "Diana Staehly (Sabine)", "Annette Paulmann (Andrea)", "Christian Heiner Wolf (Beamter der Sitte)", "Katharina Heyer (Lydia)", "Annette Kreft (Inge)", "Ulrike Kriener (Heide)", "Florian Karlheim (Tobi)", "Stefan Merki (Reiner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
