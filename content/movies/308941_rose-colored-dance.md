All of the male dancers are dressed up with evening suits and move gracefully, yet an intruder breaks up the whole scene abruptly. The film is worth seeing, even if just to see a memorable gay duet of Hijikata and Ohno. Overexposed, washed out images are sandwiched among normal ones.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mHKdtiEi0QUppHACIgSYDOFJ3BF.jpg", "actors": ["Tatsumi Hijikata ()", "Kazuo Ohno ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
