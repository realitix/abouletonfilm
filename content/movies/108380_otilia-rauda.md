The juxtaposition between fabulous beauty and disfigurement proves unsettling for the villagers and she grows up friendless, save the family's hired hand Melqu\u00edades. Though most figured she would end up as a prostitute, she is married off to Isidro, the local police chief. Cruel and petty, this ogre of a man brutalizes her and eventually infects her with venereal disease, rendering her sterile. With the help of Melqu\u00edades, Otilia takes a series of lovers to spite her husband. One day, the wounded Ruben -- a wanted outlaw -- staggers onto her doorstep and immediately she is in love. Much to Melqu\u00edades' chagrin, she harbors and tends to the criminal as her husband is out hunting for him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zs91WgmdkYgMkJPkHnDKJfI8tbS.jpg", "actors": ["Gabriela Canudas (Otilia Rauda)", "\u00c1lvaro Guerrero (Isidro)", "Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda (Maid)", "Carlos Torres Torrija (Rub\u00e9n Lazcano)", "Julieta Egurrola (Otilia's mother)", "Carlos Card\u00e1n (Otilia's father)", "Alberto Estrella (Melqu\u00edades)", "Martha Papadimitriou (Chenda)", "Juli\u00e1n Loredo (Otilia's cousin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
