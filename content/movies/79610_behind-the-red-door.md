When her agent and best friend Julia (Stockard Channing) arranges for her to accept a lucrative contract with a Boston ad agency, Natalie discovers that she will be working for her own gay brother Roy (Kiefer Sutherland), whom she hasn't seen in a decade. Although Roy is insufferably snobbish and manipulative, he manages to exert a curious control over Natalie, forcing her to confront several disturbing, long-suppressed memories of her past (shown in black-and-white flashbacks). Before the film is over, Natalie is made to realize why Roy's behavior is so overbearing -- and also, the viewer learns just how intimately Julia is involved in the lives of both siblings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hYSvVkqN3cuVYjtYwqbZkGb89bN.jpg", "actors": ["Kyra Sedgwick (Natalie)", "Kiefer Sutherland (Roy)", "Stockard Channing (Julia)", "Chuck Shamata (Father)", "Hannah Lochner (Young Natalie)", "Corey Staden (Young Roy)", "Phillip Craig (Detective Kinzer)", "Jason Carter (Sonny)", "Laura Press (MIchelle)", "Ian Eugene Ryan (Arthur)", "William Colgate (Dr. Goldberg)", "Joseph Rutten (Uncle Ernest)", "Mary Walsh (Anna)", "Frank Holden (Driver)", "Matt Sharpe (George)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [35886, 23726, 29029, 118640], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
