Travel around California with Annie, a former sex worker, Beth, a professor, and their dog Butch, in their E.A.R.T.H. Lab mobile unit, as they explore water in the Golden State. Ecosexuality shifts the metaphor \u201cEarth as Mother\u201d to \u201cEarth as Lover\u201d to create a more reciprocal and empathetic relationship with the natural world. Along the way, Annie and Beth interact with a diverse range of folks including performance artists, biologists, water treatment plant workers, scholars and others, climaxing in a shocking event that reaffirms the power of water, life and love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vHEpaSVG2mXExI3OVEImsIJv8Rk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
