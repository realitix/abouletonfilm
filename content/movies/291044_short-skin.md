Shut up in his sexless microcosm, Edoardo reacts with irritation to the pressures of the outside world, which do nothing but exacerbate his insecurity. Forced against his will to emerge from the shadows in which he has hidden for years, Edoardo will initially try to solve his problem by clumsy stratagems before finding, at last, the courage to face his own fears.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lMauwJR1CVZOsqcW0ZlNWzfQKbQ.jpg", "actors": ["Matteo Creatini (Edoardo)", "Francesca Agostini (Bianca)", "Nicola Nocchi (Arturo)", "Bianca Nappi (Daniela)", "Marianna Raschill\u00e0 (Elisabetta)", "Michele Crestacci (Roberto)", "Bianca Ceravolo (Olivia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [62365], "youtube_key": "io6IyJEFA7g"}
