I've come to the conclusion that it was mediocre. It felt like a revisit of every bad slasher flick I'd seen for the last 20 years. I do have to give credit to Tobe for humanizing some of the victims. Let's be honest, in the typical slasher flick the victims are usually drunken or doped up, teen-age sex fiends that you could care less about(and may actually enjoy seeing them get taken out:) The killer is equal parts psycho/supernatural, and his origins, limitations, and needs are never fully explained. Overall, there were some fairly grisly offings, decent character acting, but too many plot holes for me to overlook. Rent, don't buy."}], "recommandations_id": [9847, 90164, 27495, 9841]}
