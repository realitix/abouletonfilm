The Folsom Street Fair was started to call attention to gentrification and raise money for AIDS charities. FOLSOM FOREVER tells the story of how this small street fair grew into the biggest outdoor kink and fetish event in the world, and managed to do a lot of good along the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j2eZ54gOiPSQXwnY44AX9olvgGg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dr_dZubjeyM"}
