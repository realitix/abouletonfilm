The town's rabbi dies, and a sub-plot develops in which Max's father (Aaron Schwartz) and grandfather (Jan Rubes)-both synagogue leaders-are saddled with a traditional Hassidic rabbi who sticks out like a sore thumb among the otherwise assimilated Jewish community.  To make matters more difficult, Max likes a Catholic girl (14 year old Fairuza Baulk in just her third film), whom he later competes with in a piano competition.  The quirky, fun-loving rabbi tries to help him with his problems, yet harbours a secret ambition of his own.\r Filmed in Winnipeg and rural Beausejour, Manitoba, Canada.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rhQ2u3uawoIzjSCrXtR1Tip6ePa.jpg", "actors": ["Noam Zylberman (Maximilian Glick)", "Fairuza Balk (Celia Brzjinski)", "Jan Rube\u0161 (Augustus Glick)", "Susan Douglas Rubes (Bryna Glick)", "Saul Rubinek (Rabbi Teitelman)", "Aaron Schwartz (Henry Glick)", "William Marantz (Rabbi Kaminsky)", "Sharon Corder (Sarah Glick)", "Ken Zelig (Morris Moskover)", "Howard Jerome (Zelig Peikes)", "Alec McClure (Sandy Lubchuk)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
