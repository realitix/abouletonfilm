One Life, based on the cycle Pierrot Lunaire, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg\u2019s opus 21, director Oliver Herrmann has created a surreal, at times grotesque dream world set in a modern city, through which Pierrot (Christine Sch\u00e4fer) moves like a spirit. In each new number she passes through different scenes and levels of the world around us: such as an abattoir, a peep-show, a station or a supermarket.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yg6smDiYSX1229o1Q9TSJBgPhNW.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Sch\u00e4fer ()", "Pierre Boulez ()", "Sophie Cherrier ()", "Alain Damiens ()", "Florent Boffard ()", "Jeanne-Marie Conquer ()", "Jean-Guihen Queyras ()", "Ensemble Intercontemporain ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
