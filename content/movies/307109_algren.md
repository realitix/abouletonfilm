Algren's brutally honest portrayal of the American underclass and his hard-nosed lifestyle became his pathway to compassion. Through interviews with Algren contemporaries, experts, and \"literary soulmates,\" as well as through the photography of Algren's friends, Art Shay and Stephen Deutch, the film will tell his story. It will celebrate his tremendous contribution to and influence on American letters, and push Algren, champion of the marginalized, out from the margins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9TrVEzdaRca0ZBGXGFlTCovH2dU.jpg", "actors": ["Russell Banks ()", "Billy Corgan ()", "Andrew Davis ()", "William Friedkin ()", "Philip Kaufman ()", "Wayne Kramer ()", "John Sayles ()", "Suzanne McNear ()", "Stephen Elliott ()", "Simone de Beauvoir ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
