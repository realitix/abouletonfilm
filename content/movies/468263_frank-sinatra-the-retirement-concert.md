This concert was held at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angles. Vice President Agnew, his staff and the United States Secret Service, would be attending a concert at the Ahmanson Theater.  Since this was a low Key event and no speech was scheduled for the Vice President there was very little publicity and only a few reporters covering the event, those that did were primarily from the entertainment community. After meeting with the Staff and Secret Service advance people, and were briefed with the details of the VP\u2019s itinerary this is when we found out that it would be Frank Sinatra\u2019s retirement concert.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9d1eGHGboDHWCLB3Vj3uP1cWi2V.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Sinatra (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gDivfoe_Xxk"}
