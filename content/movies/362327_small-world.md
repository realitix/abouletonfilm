But in an age where any destination is in the palm of your hand- just a click away, what is left to truly explore?  Level 1 examines the universal dialect of moving down snow on two feet through a lens of fresh perspective- documenting the outer niches of a sport pushed under the rug by the modern day ski zeitgeist.  From the secret valleys of Switzerland, the ancient cities of Estonia, to the rowdy rope-tows of Minnesota- follow us around the globe as we capture skiing in its purest form. It\u2019s a Small World, after all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aLHOXSQq8VTrObMdXZ6WFYWzmmo.jpg", "actors": ["Will Wesson ()", "Will Berman ()", "LJ Strenio ()", "Shay Lee ()", "Sandy Boville ()", "Khai Krepela ()", "Wiley Miller ()", "Tanner Rainville ()", "Duncan Adams ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
