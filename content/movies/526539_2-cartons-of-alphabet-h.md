Forget all the vital intellectual and history garbage and get down to the real simple, good human feeling \u2013 and express it in a simple language that reaches people. No bullshit! (Or all bullshit?) Under the sound of the motor, Yanyan\u2019s visual and Dean\u2019s music weaves into each other; and shows the healing power of the trip to both the Chinese and Japanese souls.  Everybody, at a certain point, is a little lost and sometimes we just find a connection to someone that helps to re-inspire or center us. And that experience we'll never forget.  It\u2019s a special relationship in real life - a little bit more than friends but not an actual romance. They get each other and they both know it's not going to go anywhere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/78IvgjiIznz0Z1pRJSgZPdN4Khi.jpg", "actors": ["Dean Fujioka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
