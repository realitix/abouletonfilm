As is typical of the Turhapuro series his family and friends become closely tied in with these events. His friends H\u00e4rski Hartikainen and S\u00f6rsselss\u00f6n return to the army for a refresher course and by chance Uuno's father-in-law, Councillor Tuura is made the Finnish Defence Minister. In one of the most memorable scenes, Uuno's wife, Elisabeth, dresses as Uuno and substitutes him for a day as Uuno has an apparently urgent meeting (at a restaurant) and while becoming lost in the woods with a malfunctioning radio, Tuura accidentally declares war on Sweden.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5sfTzgVf276l9McT2sa4DgK6b6l.jpg", "actors": ["Vesa-Matti Loiri (Uuno Turhapuro)", "Marjatta Raita (Elisabeth Turhapuro)", "Spede Pasanen (H\u00e4rski Hartikainen)", "Simo Salminen (Engineer S\u00f6rsselss\u00f6n)", "Elli Castr\u00e9n (Unelma S\u00e4leikk\u00f6)", "Tapio H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36770, 62897, 36769, 62896], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
