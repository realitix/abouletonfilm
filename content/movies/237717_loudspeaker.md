They might have never run into each other, with their stark contrast in nature and life styles and would have hardly given each other a second look, if they hadn't met in these defined circumstances. But the movie throws them together, intertwined in worst of their days and progressively built in the rapport between the extremes, and infuses the spirit of worthy and meaningful life to all in the screen and those who watches them on screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jMr3mz880WX301fiMhOedwoHJM9.jpg", "actors": ["Mammootty (Mike)", "Sashi Kumar (Menon)", "Gracy Singh (Annie)", "Cochin Haneefa (Sarangadharan)", "Salim Kumar (KP)", "Jagathy Sreekumar (Secretary)", "KPAC Lalitha (Kunjannama)", "Janardhanan (Grandpa)", "Bheeman Raghu (Madhavan Nair)", "Kalpana (Rugmini)", "Anoop Menon (Dr. Ollurkkaran)", "Suraj Venjaramoodu (Counselor)", "Babu Swamy (Ouseph)", "Nayanthara Chakravarthy (Angela)", "Subair (Dr. Philson)", "Augustine (Watch Man)", "Guinness Pakru (Agent)", "Valsala Menon (Annie's mother)", "Sukumari (Head Nurse)", "Sreejith Ravi (Bachelor 1)", "Kalamandalam Gopi (Valliya Ammavan)", "Unnikrishnan Namboothiri (Muthassan)", "Rugmini Warassyar (Muthassi)", "Harisree Ashokan (Kathanar)", "Ambika Mohan (Menon's Kin)", "Abu Salim ()", "Vavachan (Ice Cream Seller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [278139, 151351, 374755, 237724], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
