They fight, philander, and feel nostalgic as they embark on a life away from home, in college. Once the party dies down they play a game: Dead Body. But when one party-goer takes the game too far, actually murdering the other guests one by one, it's up to the group to set aside their tensions, and ferret out the murderer before it's too late.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hI4sNhgBIaqYEkHs19S0NwONcHP.jpg", "actors": ["Cooper Hopkins (Dwayne)", "Leah Pfenning (Sarah)", "Rachel Brun (Ilsa)", "Miho Aizawa (Mariko)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [353058, 491132, 475603, 348656], "youtube_key": "GRjCaSrmm2A"}
