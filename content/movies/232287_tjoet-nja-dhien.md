The pious Muslim people of Aceh, a city that had flourished since ancient times as a trade port, enter into a fierce war with the Dutch. Tjoet Nja' Dhien, the widow of a rebel leader operating in Aceh in Sumatra, assumes the leadership when her husband Teuku Uma is killed in an ambush. Dhien's charismatic presence and power of survival motivate the locals to join and later continue their opposition to the Dutch. Despite personal obstacles, she remained in the thick of the struggle for ten years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ttM6nSBRHcO5pRmcxnBFKHJ9AvF.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Hakim (Tjoet Nja' Dhien)", "Piet Burnama (Panglima Laot)", "Rudy Wowor (Captain Veltman)", "Slamet Rahardjo (Teuku Umar)", "Rosihan Anwar (Habib Meulaboh)", "Rita Zahara (Nya' Bantu)", "Roy Karyadi (Dutch Officer)", "Johan Moosdijk (Dutch Officer)", "Fritz G.
