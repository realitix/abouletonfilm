This visceral new production about the limits of power will be directed by Joe Hill-Gibbins, whose previous plays include Little Revolution at the Almeida and Absolute Hell at the National Theatre.  Richard II, King of England, is irresponsible, foolish and vain. His weak leadership sends his kingdom into disarray and his court into uproar. Seeing no other option but to seize power, the ambitious Bolingbroke challenges the throne and the king\u2019s divine right to rule.  Simon Russell Beale returns to National Theatre Live screens following broadcasts of Timon of Athens and King Lear, and his recent role in the National Theatre\u2019s critically acclaimed production of The Lehman Trilogy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sOhTHB8CQPwN2kgsjhxe2gt6u2B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
