Featuring for what is believed to be the Native Americans first appearance before a motion picture camera 'Buffalo Dance' features genuine members of the Sioux Tribe dressed in full war paint and costume! The dancers are believed to be veteran members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Filmed again at the Black Maria studios by both Dickson and Heise the 'Buffalo Dance' warriors were named as Hair Coat, Parts His Hair and Last Horse. Its quite strange seeing these movies at first they all stand around waiting to begin and as they start some of the dancers look at the camera in an almost sad way at having lost their way of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4YD0GzfmGq33KJhkRuDUefTrlVn.jpg", "actors": ["Hair Coat (Himself)", "Parts His Hair (Himself)", "Last Horse (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [105160, 159908, 159904, 159905], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
