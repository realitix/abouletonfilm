Tarek is in high school, making Super 8 movies with his friend, Omar. At first the war is a lark: school has closed, the violence is fascinating, getting from West to East is a game. His mother wants to leave; his father refuses. Tarek spends time with May, a Christian, orphaned and living in his building. By accident, Tarek goes to an infamous brothel in the war-torn Olive Quarter, meeting its legendary madam, Oum Walid. He then takes Omar and May there using her underwear as a white flag for safe passage. Family tensions rise. As he comes of age, the war moves inexorably from adventure to tragedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ZHf17gdAe0eAQAZzCTzuuBwEAP.jpg", "actors": ["Rami Doueiri (Tarek Noueri)", "Naamar Sahli ()", "Mohamad Chamas (Omar)", "Rola Al Amin (May)", "Carmen Lebbos (Hala Noueri - Tarek's mother)", "Carmen Lebbos (Riad Noueri - Tarek' father)", "Liliane Nemri (Neighbor)", "Le\u00efla Karam (Oum Walid - the madame)", "Mahmoud Mabsout (Hassan - the baker)", "Hassan Farhat (Roadblock Militiaman)", "Fadi Abou Khalil (Bakery Militiaman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [119616, 49168, 81792, 86440], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
