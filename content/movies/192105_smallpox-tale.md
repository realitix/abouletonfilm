Illness in this film is as much a psychic entity as a physical one and manifests itself in an array of theatrical tableaux from grotesque women rigorously brushing their teeth to a snooker game where the players in white face makeup behave like automata. A Tale of Smallpox uses a medical theme to chart the traumatic dream life of Terayama\u2019s times, evincing deep-rooted concerns in the Japanese national psyche that hark back to the upheaval of Meiji modernisation and the devastation of World War Two.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mwc1r9B7DUO2HhY34VwHbwtu3rs.jpg", "actors": ["Keiko Niitaka ()", "Yoko Ran ()", "Takeshi Wakamatsu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
