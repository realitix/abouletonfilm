She was one of the greatest American photographers of the 20th Century. From her portraits of the avant-garde taken in Paris during the 1920's, to her documentation of New York in the 1930's, to her science photography of the 1950s, and her studies of small-town America, Abbott's genius is in the incredible range of her work. Filmed during her 91st and 92nd years, the open-hearted Abbott takes us on a guided tour of her century. The tour teaches history, perseverance, courage, and single-minded dedication to one's chosen field. A brilliant film about a brilliant American artist!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jxutJqdSJrt4AtPn3W1V5aK6vfm.jpg", "actors": ["Berenice Abbott (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
