When she loses her husband and her children, she understands she has a mission: pursuing her path of peace, that will lead her to take the vows, and then to become Saint.  Rita is a Saint of these days, who lived in a very violent age and was so brave to break free from the vengeance chain, through a deep, sincere and christian forgiveness. She is a particular Saint, talking to everybody\u2019s hearts, as she was everything. She was a daugher, a wife, a mother and a nun, she experienced every sort of life, and in all her different lives she was a living model of christian life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t3lB2te8t2bzKa7Z7Bi8FLa5c8S.jpg", "actors": ["Vittoria Belvedere (Rita)", "Martin Crewes (Paolo Mancini)", "Simone Ascani (Tomaso)", "Enzo Marino Bellanich ()", "Massimiliano Benvenuto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
