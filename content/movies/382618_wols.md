The result is reminiscent of Alain Resnais\u2019 rendition of Pablo Picasso\u2019s Guernica, as both filmed interpretations refuse to provide the viewer with a full picture of the paintings, instead fragmenting and splintering the frame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDrfDv056mNsNBUW46ue1trTPb6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
