This taped version was specially prepared for cable TV in 1981, then released on videocassette a few years later. Gregory and Maurice Hines head the exuberant, toe-tapping cast. Among the highlights are such Blake standards as \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\". The race issue is brought into play every once in a while, but never in such an omnipresent fashion as to dampen the spirits of this sparkling example of Broadway at its best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3slZNGGEa5unUcZbyFJiR6oJdWG.jpg", "actors": ["Leslie Dockery ()", "Lynnie Godfrey ()", "Gregory Hines ()", "Maurice Hines ()", "Mel Johnson Jr. ()", "Alaina Reed Hall ()", "Jeffrey V.
