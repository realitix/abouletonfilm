More than 60,000 theatre-goers went to the successful theatrical production, while the movie version of the play premiered on November 22. It was shown at Major Cineplex cinemas. This was the first time in Thailand that a stage production had been adapted for the silver screen. The film was made by GTH Studio, who used special equipment to capture the live performances on stage. They also filmed some scenes without an audience.
