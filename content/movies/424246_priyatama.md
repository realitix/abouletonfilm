After seeking Dolly's dad's blessings, they do get married and move in together. They live harmoniously for quite some time, until misunderstandings occur, minor molehills soon become mountains, and they threaten to separate from each other. That done, each goes to their respective lawyers to negotiate a divorce. When Dolly's dad finds out about this, he decides to pay them a visit. Alarmed that he will disapprove of their move to separate, both pretend to live together and show him that they are still in love. But truth has the nasty habit of showing up uninvited, and it will not be long before acrimony breaks out in his presence", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aTs1DDuGVmQTSCFp8bIB8REpU59.jpg", "actors": ["Jeetendra ()", "Neetu Singh ()", "Utpal Dutt ()", "Deven Verma ()", "Asha Sachdev ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
