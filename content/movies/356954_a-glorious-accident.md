Gould, Freeman Dyson and Stephen Toulmin) and more or less, as it were, \"eccentric\" outside the box groundbreaking intellectuals (Oliver Sacks and Rupert Sheldrake). Kayzer interviews each of them (and philosopher Daniel Dennett) individually and then has the entire group sit in a kind of round-table seminar that he moderates and lets the ideas fly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f0WUAL70VoRTbtXcWu8XtGD9qAk.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel C.
