Verdi expert Gianandrea Noseda conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a production that marked the return of the Canadian stage director Robert Carsen to the festival following a 17 year hiatus. Carsen sets his interpretation of this classic opera in the cutthroat world of the circus.  Based on Victor Hugo's play Le roi s\u2019amuse, Verdi's opera in three acts Rigoletto premiered in 1851. Similar to the play that inspired it, the opera faced censorship because of its controversial subject of libertinism at court. The opera\u2019s tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunchbacked court jester Rigoletto, and the jester\u2019s beautiful daughter, Gilda.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ytxA2dVW5Dm3ufSkkAqgAyTMRTD.jpg", "actors": ["George Gagnidze ()", "Irina Lungu ()", "Arturo Chac\u00f3n-Cruz ()", "G\u00e1bor Bretz ()", "Jos\u00e8 Maria Lo Monaco ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
