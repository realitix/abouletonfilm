After numerous failed attempts she's finally attracted the man of her dreams. Cole is handsome, strapping, strong and quiet. He's everything she's wanted in a boyfriend and then some. It's just he's so damn mysterious and she's dying to know what lurks behind those big brown eyes. Working off the suggestion of her once arch rival turned best friend, and against Cole's better judgment, Lizzy suggests a game of Truth or Dare, only to realize perhaps some deep waters may have been better left uncharted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pBnvxESttYvgMnnNbTrmeSmiQSR.jpg", "actors": ["Katherine Brunk (Lizzy)", "Jennifer Jules Hart (Samantha)", "Nathan Mohebbi (Cole)", "Ben Whalen (Michael)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
