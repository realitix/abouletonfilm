Robeson committed his support to Paul Strand and Leo Hurwitz\u2019s political semidocumentary Native Land. With Robeson\u2019s narration and songs, this beautifully shot and edited film exposes violations of Americans\u2019 civil liberties and is a call to action for exploited workers around the country. Scarcely shown since its debut, Native Land represents Robeson\u2019s shift from narrative cinema to the leftist documentaries that would define the final chapter of his controversial film career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xdI7oIeL9aYBWK60gLt9AUAXjPU.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Robeson (Narrator)", "Fred Johnson (Fred Hill)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [162445, 132136, 387646, 371001], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
