From the most humble family kitchens to the poshest restaurants, from stories of pioneering Peruvian chefs abroad to those who preserve ancient recipes at home, we find that Peru's cuisine is deliciously integrating for its people, who have historically been marked by ethnic and economic differences. Renowned chefs such as Gaston Acurio, Ferran Adria, Juan Mari Arzak and Bernardo Roca Rey share their views on Peru's cuisine alongside those unsung chefs, who also dream of Peru's cuisine as a motor of development.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y4okM4bKc2UsSfufivbJZDv2PZR.jpg", "actors": ["Gaston Acurio (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
