The sanitized studio version of her life presented a smiling kid with the big voice, who, alongside Mickey Rooney, just wanted to put on a show. But drugs, overwork, even psychological abuse at the hands of the studio is now part of the Garland legend. But despite the number of Garland books and documentaries, one account has always been missing -- Garland herself never managed to write a memoir. She did make several attempts at an autobiography, often recording stories on a tape recorder. Judy Garland: By Myself (2004), finally fills in the blanks - using Judy's personal recordings to tell the story in her own words.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e2C5NXdXyJrRjiZWppZ11pIg5ah.jpg", "actors": ["Judy Garland (Herself)", "Harris Yulin (Narrator)", "June Allyson (Herself)", "Gene Kelly (Himself)", "Del Armstrong (Himself-Makeup Artist (voice))", "Desi Arnaz (Himself)", "Lauren Bacall (Herself)", "Lucille Ball (Herself)", "Wallace Beery (Himself)", "Ray Bolger (Himself)", "Jackie Cooper (Himself)", "George Cukor (Himself)", "Buddy Ebsen (Himself)", "Roger Edens (Himself)", "Arthur Freed (Himself)", "Clark Gable (Himself)", "Leonard Gershe (Himself-Songwriter/Scenarist (voice))", "Virginia Gumm (Herself-Sister (voice))", "Jean Harlow (Herself)", "Bob Hope (Himself)", "Rock Hudson (Himself)", "Norman Jewison (Himself-Executive Producer (voice))", "Isabel Keating (Judy Garland (voice))", "Alan King (Himself)", "Burton Lane (Himself-Composer (voice))", "Mort Lindsey (Himself-Conductor/Orchestrator (voice))", "Joey Luft (Himself)", "Lorna Luft (Herself)", "Sidney Luft (Himself-Producer/Husband)", "David Margulies (Joseph L.
