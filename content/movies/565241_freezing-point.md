Keizo secretly blames his wife Natsue because he suspects her of having an affair with his colleague Murai, and having been too distracted to keep proper watch over the child. Being a proud man, he does not accuse her directly, but concocts, instead, a twisted revenge against her. Pretending it is to comfort his devastated wife, Keizo arranges for them to adopt a baby girl. What he hasn't told Natsue, is that the baby is the orphaned daughter of the murderer, a tragic day-laborer who has hanged himself while in police custody. He plans to reveal the child's origins after Natsue has given her heart to the child-- when it will cause the greatest possible hurt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xByatMOBRbrdK0atiTSt80hac0F.jpg", "actors": ["Satomi Ishihara (Yoko Tsujiguchi (around 18 years old))", "Naoko Iijima (Natsue Tsujiguchi)", "Kayoko Kishimoto (Tatsuko Shimada)", "Yuya Tegoshi (Toru Tsujiguchi (around 23 years old))", "Kazuki Kitamura ()", "Manami Honj\u00f4 (Yukako Matsuzaki)", "Shunsuke Kubozuka (Sota Kitahara)", "Akiyoshi Nakao (Tatsuya Mitsui)", "Shihori Kanjiya (Junko Aizawa)", "Misako Yasuda (Yumi Kano)", "Chikako Kaku (Keiko Mitsui)", "Fumiya Togawa (Toru Tsujiguchi (14 years old))", "Yuichi Kimura ()", "Y\u00f4ko \u00d4shima ()", "Takehiko Ono (Detective Wada)", "Mitsuru Fukikoshi (Tsuchio Saishi)", "Ei Morisako (Yoko Tsujiguchi (around 9 years old))", "Takanori Jinnai ()", "Toru Nakamura (Keizo Tsujiguchi)", "Keiko Takeshita (Yoko Tsujiguchi (60 years old))", "Masahiko Tsugawa (Sota Kitahara (60 years old))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
