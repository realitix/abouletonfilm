Each is convinced that what they need in order to have a more fulfilling life is an extramarital affair, and they intend to take their medicine, no matter how distatsteful it proves to be. Luckly for the audience, it proves to be awful indeed, as they attempt to set fire to this soggy fuel for romance in a series of ill-starred dates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lV34asQgzLcxjKpc24ouilPwrDV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
