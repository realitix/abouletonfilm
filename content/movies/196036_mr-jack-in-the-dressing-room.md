Their costumes indicate that the entertainment on offer here is something less than grand opera: one actress is dressed somewhat demurely, but another is in (by 1904 standards) a skimpy chorus-girl costume, whilst the third is dressed like the principal boy in a panto: fully covered, but in a form-fitting outfit that makes clear her feminine charms.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
