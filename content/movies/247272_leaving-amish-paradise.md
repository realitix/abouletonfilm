The Amish travel by horse and buggy and dress exactly as their forebears did when they first arrived in America almost 300 years ago. They have countless rules which keep them separate from the modern world, with electric lights, mobile phones, television and radio all forbidden. For those born into this culture, leaving is the biggest decision they'll ever make.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/khFFqmGIHlKXKfBcKJ4fPAX0MvK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
