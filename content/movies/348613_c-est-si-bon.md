There Geun-tae, a na\u00efve country boy, meets the young musical prodigies Hyung-joo and Chang-sik, and forms the band named after it -- the C\u2019est Si Bon Trio. As the three young artists bicker over their music, beautiful socialite Ja-young enters the picture and becomes their muse, and a series of moving love songs come from it. Geun-tae\u2019s pure-heartedness wins Ja-young over but when she accepts a once-in-lifetime opportunity for a shot at an acting career, they part ways. After 20 years, the untold story of their love, song, and youth at C\u2019est Si Bon is finally brought to light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1b4P4iiVwLOpZpQVH3KnkfZ7cTu.jpg", "actors": ["Jung Woo (Oh Geun-tae (20s))", "Kim Yoon-seok (Oh Geun-tae (40s))", "Han Hyo-joo (Min Ja-young (20s))", "Kim Hee-ae (Min Ja-young (40s))", "Jin Goo (Lee Jang-hee (20s))", "Jang Hyun-sung (Lee Jang-hee (40s))", "Kang Ha-neul (Yoon Hyung-joo)", "Jo Bok-rae (Song Chang-sik)", "Kwon Hae-hyo (Kim Choon-sik)", "Lee Mi-so (Ran)", "Lee Dae-yeon (Geun-tae's father)", "Ahn Jae-hong (Byung-chul)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [384641, 385261, 56247], "youtube_key": "ESvyMS8zyXo"}
