Using the \u201cemulsion lift\u201d technique on 16mm film, sections of emulsion were lifted off, torn up or smudged, and then re-adhered. In combination with digital video technology, Pruska-Oldenhof creates an intricate analogue-digital weave that explores both the body\u2019s and the film\u2019s surface. The film emulsion wrinkles, rips and dissolves - reminding us that it, like human flesh, is fragile and perishable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jVXrnNqtlBx7oxVvTK1amQNfc23.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
