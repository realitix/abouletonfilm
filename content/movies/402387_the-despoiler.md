Ince may well have been the director of The Despoiler as indicated by the credits; but since Ince was known far and wide as a glory-hogger, it's also possible that one of his talented lieutenants wielded the megaphone. A Civil War drama, The Despoiler refuses to take sides, demonstrating that there are heroes and villains in both camps. Capturing a small town, Colonel Charles K. French orders his men to reclaim the funds raised for the enemy by the townsfolk. French's drunken, lacivious second-in-command Frank Keenan intends to extort money from the citizens by threatening the virtue of the town's female population.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dSn6qN7a7V3KJgwu3zeoOSaKLRM.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Keenan ()", "Enid Markey ()", "Charles K.
