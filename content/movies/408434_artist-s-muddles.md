Luckenbach is a great portrait artist suffering under the slight handicap of being unable to \"do ears.\" The artist has painted a beautiful portrait of the wife of Pietro Cellini with the exception that her left ear is several times larger than it should be and not painted very well at that. Cellini also holds the keys to the city and Luckenbach getting the job of painting the city hall rides on Cellini's satisfaction with his wife's portrait. Andy accompanies the artist back to his studio, and this short being made in the pre-code days ensures the studio is filled with models wearing a little less than somewhat and less than that in a couple of cases.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Andy Clyde (Andy 'Sunshine' Wilson)", "Vernon Dent (Luckenbach, the artist)", "Faye Pierre (Mrs. Georgette Cellini)", "Luis Alberni (Pietro Cellini)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
