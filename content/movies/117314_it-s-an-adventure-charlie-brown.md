He goes to camp to take his mind off of baseball with a paper sack on his head to cover up said rash and is suddenly elected camp president as the other kids find his appearance cool.  But then he removes his sack the next morning and becomes uncool again.  He watches the sun rise, fearing that it will appear as a rising baseball. Instead, the sun is replaced with MAD Magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8dYQcduWPzX2YKPvtINH2MQ12QW.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Catalano (Charlie Brown (voice))", "Angela Lee (Lucy van Pelt (voice))", "Rocky Reilly (Linus van Pelt (voice))", "Cindi Reilly (Sally Brown (voice))", "Brent Hauer (Patricia 'Peppermint Patty' Reichardt (voice))", "Michael Dockery (Marcie (voice))", "Brad Schacter (Schoeder (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
