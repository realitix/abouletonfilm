Brought to life by an antique dealer, the golem is used as a menial servant. Eventually falling in love with the dealer's wife, it goes on a murderous rampage when its love for her goes unanswered. This mostly lost film (please check your attic) is often confused with director Paul Wegener second and readily available interpretation of the legend; Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam (1920).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zW1xgMLIqcCmF6S2ic9oy3ncWrE.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Wegener (Golem)", "Rudolf Bl\u00fcmner (Gelehrter)", "Carl Ebert (Troedler)", "Henrik Galeen (Graf)", "Lyda Salmonova ()", "Robert A.
