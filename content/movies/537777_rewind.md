It clicks, pounds, whooshes, hums, and crackles around the quietly resounding basic theme of the piece. The abstract visual level emphasises the soundtrack, suggesting a digital score, and is vaguely reminiscent of music applications, the user-interface of composition software. At the same time the minimalist images suggest a continual forwards movement, gliding ahead on a parallel voyage through the virtual space: mobile geometry.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
