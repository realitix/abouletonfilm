As a teenager, in the early 1960's Bert sat at the feet of Brownie McGhee at the Howff Folk Club in Edinburgh mesmerised by 'Key to the Highway'. Armed with that raw American Blues influence and a bewildering technique, he fashioned sublime interpretations of traditional and blues music on the acoustic guitar. The result was music that had a profound influence on a generation of musicians including Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Neil Young, and it still inspires todays' generation of guitarists and singers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wWWVOIKnVsLWJsoVJXgJSjOcd8Y.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Briggs (Herself)", "Jackson C.
