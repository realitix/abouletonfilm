Gubaidulina authored that piece for Gideon Kremer. Curiously, it would be another 12 years before Gubaidulina received a commission (from Paul Sacher) to author her second violin concerto, and another 15 years after that until the notes fell on ears ripe with anticipation. For the debut of the \"Second Violin Concerto,\" Gubaidulina insisted that no one other than German violin virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter perform it. That Mutter performance from August 2007 appears, in its entirety, in this classical concert film. Jan Schmidt-Garre directs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bFtvSFCWcvl6V7lIfvHxDJj94dE.jpg", "actors": ["Sofia Gubaidulina ()", "Anne-Sophie Mutter ()", "Gidon Kremer ()", "Simon Rattle ()", "Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
