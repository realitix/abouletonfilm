The film opens during the swinging '20s when a beautiful young woman, married against her will to a brutish thug of a man, endures a tension-fraught honeymoon. During the Depression segment, a mail-order bride from China meets her husband for the first time. Following the end of WWII, a soldier returns home to meet his girlfriend and his best friend. During the paranoia of the 1950s, a professor searches for his wife. During the 1980s, a lawyer has too much sex and debt, and during the dawn of the millennium, a woman comes to a newly refurbished room 720 to meet her Internet lover. Such acclaimed Canadian actors as Tom McCamus, Sandrine Holt, and Colm Feore star in this film, which was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9AN3jcntvQ5BT87tyBRt4nyr6Yd.jpg", "actors": ["Joel Bissonnette (Danny)", "Lindy Booth (Supergirl/Sylvia)", "Albert Chung (Cheung)", "Colm Feore (Sebastian)", "David Hewlett (Michael)", "Sandrine Holt (Jin)", "Noam Jenkins (Young Salvatore)", "Marvin Kaye (Hotel Manager)", "Janet Kidder (Beth)", "Mia Kirshner (Dominique)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
