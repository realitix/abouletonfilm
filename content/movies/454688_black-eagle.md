Henry. William Bishop stars as Jason Bond, who stays out of trouble by the simple expedient of avoiding other people. Unfortunately, the plot dictates that Bond must come into contact with several characters, all of whom end up fleecing our hero in one way or another. Even so, Jason manages to enjoy a brief romance with pretty Ginny Long (Virginia Patton) before returning to his life of carefree vagabondage. A very minor film, The Black Eagle makes the most of its excellent supporting cast, including Gordon Jones, Trevor Bardette, Will Wright and stuntman extraordinaire Richard Talmadge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fw0XqGeFkkCNLBBPf0cdvpEYtwE.jpg", "actors": ["William Bishop (Jason Bond)", "Virginia Patton (Ginny Long)", "Gordon Jones (Benjy Laughton)", "James Bell (Frank Hayden)", "Trevor Bardette (Mike Long)", "Will Wright (Sheriff Clancy)", "Edmund MacDonald (Si)", "Paul E.
