He's built a supercar from scratch, put together a 200 mph plane and painstakingly restored various rusty wrecks back to their former glory and all in front of television cameras. He's even built his own helicopter. But, in this, his latest quest, Mark takes on a more down-to-earth challenge shared by millions of motorists every year: How to get the best price possible for your car when the time comes to sell.  Mark asks a stranger to lend him her 5-Series BMW Estate. It's 12 years old, done 130,000 miles and, although much loved, is in a sad and sorry state. Once bright red all over, the paintwork is now various shades of pink and the car is filthy dirty, inside and out. It's been valued at just \u00a3375.  What happens next is nothing short of miraculous. Coached by an experienced valeting professional, but using only DIY car cleaning products, Mark and his old friend Pete \"Mate\" wash, wipe, preen and polish the Beamer beyond recognition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k2Y7YOcDxOVpoX8wZoDUppZEkPr.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Evans (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
