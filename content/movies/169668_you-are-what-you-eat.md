The film was one of the first exponents of the mobile camera-rock track-optical effect school of filmmaking, and it is much a document as it is a documentary. A repellent and fascinating depiction of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, along with Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco and the East Village in New York. Tiny Tim amounts to something resembling a recurring motif and narrator.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5972qs9x2BppCfjMqIgHdSN0WGi.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Butterfield (Himself)", "David Crosby (HImself)", "Luana Anders ()", "Del Close ()", "Rick Danko ()", "Bonnie Dewberry ()", "Dave Dixon ()", "Family Dog (Themselves)", "Electric Flag (Themselves)", "Carl Franzoni ()", "John Giles ()", "Harpers Bizarre ()", "Chet Helms ()", "John Herald ()", "Garth Hudson ()", "Jerry Leiber ()", "Robbie Robertson ()", "Sharmagne Leland-St. John (Super Nun Sister Immaculata Baby!)", "Peter Yarrow ()", "Marilyn Salisbury (Freak-Out Dancer)", "Tiny Tim (Himself)", "Frank Zappa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
