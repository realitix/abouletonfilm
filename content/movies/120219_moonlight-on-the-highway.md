A troubled young man, David Peters (Ian Holm), claims, \"Once dreams were possible, that's what the popular songs told us.\" Rejecting rock music of the day, Peters is immersed in the tunes of Thirties crooner Al Bowlly (killed during the London blitz). He collects Bowlly memorabilia, publishes the Bowlly fan-club newsletter, and finds pleasure in lip-synching Bowlly records but his obsession with Bowlly masks certain darker events in his past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lOWVqNFO254HSI8Y5rXCiBxJ60F.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Holm ()", "Anthony Bate ()", "Deborah Grant ()", "Robin Wentworth ()", "Frederick Peisley ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
