The basic framework of the film is provided by intercutting of two counterposed materials. On the one hand, it uses black-and-white, endlessly accelerating and rhythmically varying images of the inexorable forward motion of the racing cars. On the other hand, it uses colourful, extreme slow-motion images  of details of a chequered flag fluttering in\r the wind. The escalating speed, growing abstraction and mosaic-like repetition of images leads on to manipulated, yet realistic images of human bodies used in crash tests. In the end, all that is left is the black-and-white flash of speed, the gyrating pulse of the mosaic, the details of the human bodies and the intense soundtrack. Routemaster has some of the qualities of a live concert.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cxFvBJVbCeYHLFS3R64JPUJ62nJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
