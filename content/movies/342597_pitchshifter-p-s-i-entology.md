The DVD was the second release from PSI Records which is run by members Mark Clayden and J.S. Clayden. The DVD was released ostensibly as a \"thank you\" to the band's loyal fan base. The release prompted the band to reform after their 2003 split to take part in a seven date tour of Britain in October of 2004. The DVD live show is set in Rock City, Nottingham.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ahomlh9ektZz6BKQqrHbIG2N5C6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
