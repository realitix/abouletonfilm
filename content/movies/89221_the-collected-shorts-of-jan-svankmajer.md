Utilizing a delirious combination of puppets, humans, stop-motion animation, and live action, Svankmajer's films conjure up a dreamlike universe that is at once dark, macabre, witty, and perversely visceral.  KimStim (and Kino) is proud to to offer this collection of remarkable short works from an artist that has mesmerized audiences the world over and has inspired filmmakers from the Brothers Quay to Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pV3xSPxJRRfq6FULEb1HrIPMWMQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
