Using spliced-together strips of colored film leader in white, yellow, blue, red, green, etc., Lawder ran the film through a projector and found the results to be quite boring. While he was running the film, though, he noticed how beautiful the colored strips of film looked as they ran through the projector. So, he turned a camera on the projector and filmed the colored film gorgeously winding its way through the projector's machinery.\" - Noel Black, Colorado Springs Independent", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jQCMXLYezcKSdDFk74hhzKypomb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [146565, 154616, 163227, 163225], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
