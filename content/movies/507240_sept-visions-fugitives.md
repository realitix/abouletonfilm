Cahen writes: \"The looking and listening audiences are confronted \u2014 in addition to the pure impressions \u2014 with basic questions about work (the child using a traditional device to shake the feathers from the mattress) about freedom, about life in China... and ultimately about life and death: the burial, the bird, the man with a sheaf of straw on his back symbolizing the passage, the beyond... I had to struggle to make what I know are stereotyped images my own. The pure impressions and raw filmic material are completely reworked, going much further than the original takes.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tFB1XpsnLhE"}
