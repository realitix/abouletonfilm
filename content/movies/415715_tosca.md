Critics, for their part, have often had problems with Tosca\u2019s rather grungy subject matter, the directness and intensity of its score, and the crowd-pleasing dramatic opportunities it provides for its lead roles. But these same aspects have also made Tosca one of a handful of iconic works that seem to represent opera in the public imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qeiErWjX23wIMBDibswb5MWb0FP.jpg", "actors": ["Fiorenza Cedolins (Floria Tosca, a famous singer)", "Marcelo \u00c1lvarez (Mario Cavaradossi)", "Ruggero Raimondi (Il barone Scarpia)", "Marco Spotti (Cesare Angelotti)", "Enrico Facini (Spoletta)", "Fabio Previati (The sacristan)", "Giuliano Pelizon (Police officer)", "Angelo Nardinocchi (A jailer)", "Ottavia Dorrucci (A shepherd boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
