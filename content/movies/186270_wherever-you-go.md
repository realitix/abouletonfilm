Zuhara is on her way to her younger sister\u2019s wedding, when she picks up Neriman, a young Bedouin hitchhiker escaping from an arranged marriage. As she unintentionally becomes an accomplice in Neriman\u2019s struggle, Zuhara must confront her conflicted feelings toward her estrangement from her own family. Director Rony Sasson Angel sensitively evokes moving drama through the characters\u2019 quiet exchanges, while building to a powerful climax. Stars Hila Vidor and Maisa Abed Elhadi make the tension and camaraderie between these two strangers palpable and touching. A deeply-poignant and visually-striking road movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eBCm8TAcrvXNHiJdhABY6kBWgvK.jpg", "actors": ["Hilla Vidor ()", "Maisa Abd Elhadi ()", "SHAHIR CABHA ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SZaVH4vacZM"}
