But everything is going wrong. The subject of his documentary, the western 'Guns on the Clackamas' is plagued with problems. The lead actress has a severe stutter. And since she also happens to be the Executive Producer's mistress, there's not much that can be done to remedy the situation. Unsuccessful in turning the movie into a yodeling extravaganza, they decide to fire the actress. This results in having her irate beau pull the plug on the film's financing. The beginning of the end is marked by cast members dropping like flies due to any number of reasons. Bad macaroni salad. Bad chili. Bad caterer. A camera dolly runs over a crew member, severing some key limb or another. Then since no cast member has survived, and the film's producers can't hire replacements, the 'Guns on Clackamas' makers must resort to solutions at once startling and hilarious.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZIu4Me2KGXErKfkhO3ZWOozxUR.jpg", "actors": ["John Bader (Carl 'Safety First' Huggins)", "Danny Bruno (Sol Kaplan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
