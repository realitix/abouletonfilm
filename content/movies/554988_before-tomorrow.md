Both men are ordered to give close protection to Siegfried, a suspected murderer. Wagner lives in an old fashioned apartment, he counts birds, listens to Richard Wagner's operas, sees a lot, does little, meets a woman, gets entangled - and in the end he loses his countenance. A story about good-wanting and wrong-doing, about relationships and people in contemporary Berlin.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Axel Buchholz (Wagner)", "Axel Sichrovsky (Zippolt)", "Regine Zimmermann (Corinna)", "Christoph Grunert (Siegfried)", "Ralph Kretschmar (Karlos)", "Matthias Rott (Fahrer)", "Tatja Seibt (Tante)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
