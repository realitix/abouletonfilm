Her mother, a filmmaker, started filming her to document the seizures. When Agnes\u2019 baby-babbling disappears and her attention turns inward, one suspects autism. All experience and education is futile, the mother is left tending to her child, who needs constant care and seems to slip away from all communication. Agnes can\u2019t speak, she doesn\u2019t respond to verbal language and she can\u2019t point her finger to show what she wants. Her ever-present older sister wants to play, but she gets no response. However, Agnes does have a language. She expresses her will, anger and joy. The Hummingchild gives a glimpse into a mother\u2019s journey, over a span of five years, towards contact with her daughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sWkRqlgWPLsaSE7mLKbrkHhI52O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
