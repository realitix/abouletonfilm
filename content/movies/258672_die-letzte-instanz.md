Ms. Altenburg comes from G\u00f6rlitz and was visiting Berlin with her church group. After the crime, Ms. Altenburg suffered a fainting spell and is in hospital. Lawyer Joachim Vernau offers his help to the woman - he travels to G\u00f6rlitz to get her personal belongings. When he returns, Margarete has died in the clinic. Vernau does not let go of this case: The old lady can not have planned the murder attempt on Hellmer alone. Who got her the weapon?
