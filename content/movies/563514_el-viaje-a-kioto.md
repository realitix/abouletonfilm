What begins as a tragicomedy about a musician clinging to a distant past where he tasted glory, ends up being a precise metaphor for our day, where we all have the same pretensions of living an old success.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
