She speaks to Tanaoa, a young  man in search of the fading identity of his people. Eye-witness  accounts recall the nuclear testing done by French colonizers  from 1966 \u2013 1996 on the French Polynesian atolls Moruroa and  Fangataufa, near Tahiti. The words can be heard to the hollow  rumbling sound of a bomb explosion in slow-motion, resembling  the roar of traditional Polynesian drums. The Ma\u2019ohi sensed the horror around them, yet they were disempowered and  could not turn away. Poet and political activist Flora Devatine\u2019s ethereal words recapitulate and empower the voices of a people seeking the path of independence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zYeeZGnTw5KggBNXW01DzdjJmib.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
