Donald Sinden plays Lieutenant Green, a radar expert in the Royal Navy. One night, whilst under the influence of alcohol, he welds an old pram to the deck of a foreign destroyer for a joke. The next morning, British Intelligence is desperate to know what the enemy\u2019s new weapon is. To cover his tracks, Green calls it the \u2018998\u2019. When he is posted to the destroyer to explain about radar techniques, Green soon realizes that his prank has gone too far.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1oGDfF3eCh952i8vgJHnwgWjiSd.jpg", "actors": ["Akim Tamiroff ()", "Donald Sinden ()", "Sarah Lawson ()", "Naunton Wayne ()", "Marianne Stone ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
