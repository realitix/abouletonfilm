Having grown up in Russia's crazy 1990s, an era filled with constant and drastic change, these teenagers have no solid ground beneath their feet. They are trapped in a strange world in which their money-obsessed parents lead senseless lives and even kill each other. Vika is twenty years old. She has black fingernail polish, wears pink dresses, and is constantly depressed. While working at a pizza place, she gets an order for a pizza delivery from Venya, a strange twenty year old boy who lives all alone in a deserted apartment in the middle of Moscow. Venya suffers from agarophobia, the fear of open space. When Vika arrives Venya lets her in and locks the door behind her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsZNwIeEu3bl2X3MZ8aiJcJD5qe.jpg", "actors": ["Leonid Bichevin (\u0412\u0435\u043d\u044f)", "Maria Mashkova (\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0430)", "Oleg Makarov (\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a)", "Aleksandr Sklyar (\u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0442)", "Aleksandr Ilin (\u041b\u0451\u043d\u044f)", "Elena Shevchenko (\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430)", "Anatoli Uzdenskiy (\u0410\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434)", "Grigory Kalinin (waiter)", "Nelly Uvarova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [73318, 62757, 203780, 73281], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
