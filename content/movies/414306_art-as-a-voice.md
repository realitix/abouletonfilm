Exploring their history, challenges, art form, influences and experiences that led them to activism, the documentary will provide an understanding of the realities of life as a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault. Though the film will tell each story honestly, mixing visuals of the artist at work, voiceover interviews describing events and dramatic actor re-enactments, the overall message will highlight how each artist has turned something so ugly into something beautiful that inspires hope.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Phoenix Amor (Singer and Domestic Violence Survivor)", "Tanya Upshur (Reenactment Actor/Abuse Victim)", "Jason Jones (Reenactment Actor/Abuser)", "Lauren Bullock (Spoken Word Artist/Rape Survivor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
