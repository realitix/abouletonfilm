When their lives are once again in danger in spring 2015, it\u2019s mostly the women and children who flee over the border to China. Wang Bing accompanies a few of these communities thrown together by fate, at once modern and almost mythical and archaic. They wander the remote mountains with few possessions, camp in makeshift compounds and can sometimes earn a few yuan during the sugarcane harvest. Or they move on to the next place \u2013 which is never any better. Sometimes, around the evening campfire, they talk about what they\u2019ve experienced \u2013 until someone says that it\u2019d be better not to talk at all, it\u2019s too painful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hfUXN23urRlC9thNPYyeGlWg1wl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
