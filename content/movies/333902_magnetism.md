The phone message he repeatedly listens to on his phone is fragmented. He cycles to a crossroads where a bunch of flowers with a note attached is taped to a gatepost, then on to a scrapyard.

The owner of the yard calls out to him, his dog finally chasing the man away.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
