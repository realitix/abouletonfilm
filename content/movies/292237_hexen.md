The same happens when pigs again and again disappear from different farmyards. The village residents firmly believe that witches are the reason for this mystery. Not even police detective K\u00fchlemann who is sent to Hunsdorf is able to dissuade them from their superstition. Thus, the farmers think his investigation is aimless and they do not support him at all. With a lot of patience and well-made arguments he finally convinces little Peter that there are no witches. Next, Peter\u2019s grandfather and teacher Marianne take K\u00fchlemann\u2019s side. With their support, the police detective eventually finds out the truth and is able to put a stop to the gang of crooks that had been stealing the pigs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9N185JbBUfVPhRak7o7dRi53V8x.jpg", "actors": ["Lothar Blumhagen (Werner K\u00fchlemann)", "Alfred Maack (August Bast)", "Helene Riechers (Milda Bast)", "Albert Garbe (B\u00fcrgermeister Seidel-Gro\u00dfkopf)", "Heinz Triebel (Peter Bast)", "Edith Volkmann (Frau des Pfundst\u00fcten-Enderlein)", "Aribert Grimmer ()", "Hans Klering ()", "Rudi Schiemann ()", "Lisa Wehn ()", "Ulrich von der Trenck ()", "Karla Runkehl ()", "Gerd Michael Henneberg ()", "Amy Frank ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
