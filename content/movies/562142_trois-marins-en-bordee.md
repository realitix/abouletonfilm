What Jean doesn't know is that the lady of his heart is twice as old as he thinks, for the photo she has sent her was one of her young niece Jacqueline, instead of her. Things get complicated when Jean turns up at the Botarin manor, escorted by two other sailors. The young man immediately falls under the spell of Jacqueline, which drives the marchioness crazy. The latter resorts to various subterfuges to separate the lovebirds, but to no avail. She will end up marrying a gendarme who has been her suitor for years while Jean weds his beloved Jacqueline.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddxISD44A8CY45MdTwKBjQuug4q.jpg", "actors": ["Alain Baug\u00e9 ()", "Pierre Brebans ()", "Janie Carnac ()", "Gabrielle Doulcet ()", "Andr\u00e9 Gabriello ()", "Mag-Avril ()", "Tania Miller ()", "Patrick Novel ()", "Gaston Orbal ()", "Perchik ()", "Pierre St\u00e9phen ()", "Alice Tissot ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
