Its leader, Steve Jobs, was a long-haired college dropout with infinite ambition, and an inspirational perfectionist with a bully's temper. A man of contradictions, he fused a Californian counterculture attitude and a mastery of the art of hype with explosive advances in computer technology.  Insiders including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, the chairman who ousted Jobs from the company he founded, and Jobs' chief of software, tell extraordinary stories of the rise, fall and rise again of Apple with Steve Jobs at its helm.  With Stephen Fry, world wide web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and branding guru Rita Clifton, Evan Davis decodes the formula that took Apple from suburban garage to global supremacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/91Q6PEea2c0Epzoifyf14ReINHZ.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Jobs (Himself (archive footage))", "Steve Wozniak (Himself)", "John Sculley (Himself)", "Andy Hertzfeld (Himself)", "Daniel Kottke (Himself)", "Evan Davis (Himself)", "Bob Cringely (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [293006, 27737, 419324, 144124], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
