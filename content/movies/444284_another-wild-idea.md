To test it, Betty's father zaps Charley hoping his newly-aberrant behavior will cause Betty to end her affections for the milquetoast. Dad's plan backfires: the invention works perfectly, Charley gets a backbone, and Betty loves her new forceful man. However, Charley's courage and lack of a superego get him in trouble with the law. He goes on trial for assaulting a bullying police officer. Is Charley going up the river leaving Betty high and dry?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8eiFV6pGIvAEEsVgrIw5yLPn1TS.jpg", "actors": ["Charley Chase (Charley)", "Betty Mack (Betty)", "Frank Austin (Betty's Father)", "Harry Bernard (Policeman)", "Harry Bowen (Vegetable Man)", "Baldwin Cooke (Radio Man)", "Harry Dunkinson (Judge)", "Billy Gilbert (Uncle Percy (voice))", "Carlton Griffin (District Attorney)", "Charlie Hall (Man Pushed into Fountain)", "Arthur King (Leader of Singers)", "Charles Lloyd (Betty's Father's Assistant)", "Kay McCoy (Girl)", "James C.
