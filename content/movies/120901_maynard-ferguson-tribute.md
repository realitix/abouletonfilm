Trumpet player, friend and personal manager, Steve Schankman worked with Maynard's family and alumni musicians to develop a one of a kind tribute - a true labor of love and a celebration of Maynard's life as one of the greats in jazz history. Held September 20, 2006 at the University of Missouri-St. Louis Touhill Performing Arts Center in St. Louis, this tribute Concert brought together more than 30 alumni artists from Maynard's fifty plus years  of entertaining audiences around the world. In a manner of words, the tribute was the ultimate symphony dedicated to a man they called \"The Boss\". His dedication  to education and his pure love of sound made Maynard the kind of performer these musicians strive to be today. He is a beloved hero, entertainer, bandleader, mentor and friend whose legend will live on in every trumpet note.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jnDRzUegwS2eBCYcrG1XYGsK15z.jpg", "actors": ["Serafin Aguilar ()", "Danny Barber ()", "Wayne Bergeron ()", "Pete Ferguson ()", "Carl Fischer ()", "Ernie Hammes ()", "Patrick Hession ()", "Roger Ingram ()", "Stan Mark ()", "Eric Miyashiro ()", "Dennis Noday ()", "Peter Olstad ()", "Steve Schankman ()", "Lew Soloff ()", "Andrea Tofanelli ()", "Walter White ()", "Christian Jacob ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
