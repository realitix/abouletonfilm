A group of superstitious inhabitants have erected a scarecrow for protection but soon find themselves terrorized by it. Made at the end of the Shah\u2019s reign, the film offers a metaphorical reflection on power relations \u2014 how people create their own idols who turn around to terrorize them. The film\u2019s alleged political message was found so dangerous that it was banned both pre- and post-revolution. It was presented to great acclaim in Cannes Film Festival\u2019s Critics' Week section.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kxwq7ADvAtoROY1oZjPqvJFbMzR.jpg", "actors": ["Faramarz Gharibian (Abdollah)", "Saeed Nikpoor (Headmaster)", "Kiumars Malekmotei (Doctor)", "Anik Shefrazian (Soghra)", "Hossein Kazbian ()", "Atash Khayyer ()", "Fereydoon Yoosefi ()", "Agha Jan Rafii ()", "Maliheh Nazari ()", "Sami Tahasuni ()", "Esmail Mohammadi ()", "Minoo Abrishami ()", "Ashraf Kashani ()", "Mehri Mehrinia ()", "Nadia Khalipoor (Narges)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
