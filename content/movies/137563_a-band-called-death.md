Un trio compos\u00e9 de Bobby, David et Dannis Hackney. Les trois frangins ont enregistr\u00e9 en 1976 un single, Politicians in my eyes, avant de tomber dans l\u2019oubli. La faute \u00e0 l\u2019intransigeance du groupe qui n\u2019a pas voulu chang\u00e9 de nom pour signer avec une maison de disques\u2026 La faute \u00e0 cette infection du dance floor qui rel\u00e9gua le rock aux oubliettes : le disco.\r Depuis, de l\u2019eau a coul\u00e9 sous les ponts.

Misunderstood and marginalized in their time, they endured a lot of rejection and settled into lives that turned out differently than for what they had hoped. Then, after their music is rediscovered and shared, they reunite, but with a heavy heart knowing their visionary leader did not live to see the rebirth. And yet, through that malaise, the band's story is one of joy, familial devotion, and believing in something so strongly, it can't help but come true. It shows that powerful art can create double lives. It shows the unknown pleasures of digging into the past for the untold stories. And the songs? Dang man, these songs slay."}], "recommandations_id": [268159, 172548, 259999, 84177], "youtube_key": "hAcLnf6Tx_A"}
