A man with this name dies twice \u2013 once in 1969, in Israel, and a second time in 1987, in Innsbruck. This goes unnoticed, at first. In 2010, when a relative in London leaves a house as inheritance, the question arises both in Israel and in Innsbruck: Who was Ernst Beschinsky really?  A true story, told by numerous forged documents and many authentic reports.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Yair Lev (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
