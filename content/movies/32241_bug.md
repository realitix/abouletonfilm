One person's disaster becomes another's boon, and vice versa--because a man loses his job, a young girl becomes the lead ballerina in the school play, which in turn causes the death of a pet pig. These characters weave around Los Angeles and each other as seemingly mundane events fall into place, putting them on a collision course with a common fate and one heroic act of competence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zWz6yoYyyXDSq0ZOUCqgkRdoMVQ.jpg", "actors": ["John Carroll Lynch (Wallace Gregory)", "Brian Cox (Cyr)", "Jamie Kennedy (Dwight)", "Sarah Paulson (Eilleen)", "Christina Kirk (Olive)", "Arabella Field (Annelle Johnston)", "Alexis Cruz (Sung)", "Stoney Westmoreland (Kevin's Father)", "Ed Begley Jr. (The Dept. of Health Inspector / 'The Hand')"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [73897, 162006, 32229, 32150], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
