It leads you through his teen years where he made avant garde films, his apprenticeship with Shaw Brothers' martial arts director Chang Che, his coming of age as a director directing slapstick Hong Kong comedies through the 70s and 80s. It charts the genesis of the groundbreaking A Better Tomorrow starring Chow Yun Fat, a film that creates a new genre in Hong Kong cinema and launches Woo's career into the international arena.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uu1Ge0jD7CkgnjB6RUXeOMNnvDN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
