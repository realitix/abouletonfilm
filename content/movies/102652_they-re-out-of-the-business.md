Having not spoken to one another since a late-nineties falling out, they're each grappling with the challenges of stalled careers and relationships, as the hands of time creep ominously past forty-o'clock. Splick's most recent TV show, centered around his character's perverse relationship with dessert foods, is unceremoniously cancelled by the network, forcing a return to his childhood bedroom at his mother's apartment in New York. Frustrated by a barrage of comments about the \"good,\" \"funny,\" movies he used to make with his old partner, Jason, Splick determines to seek him out and attempt a reunion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2urBa78okFhHXfg9TkGwRD3AbsG.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Schaeffer (Splick)", "Donal Lardner Ward (Jason)", "Diane Davis (April)", "Stefanie E.
