He had his cinematographer Gary Graver film the session with a view to editing highlights of the footage into the projected film. Graver observed, \"A lot of people were there in the audience that day who are successful filmmakers now\",[1] as well as several noted film critics such as Joseph McBride and Todd McCarthy.[2]  However, Welles never got round to editing the raw footage. Its only use in Welles' lifetime was by BBC journalist Leslie Megahy for his 1982 Arena documentary on Welles; specifically, the documentary features a young man asking Welles whether he would agree he has been persecuted by The Establishment and the capitalist system, and Welles being somewhat bemused by the question.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2iqLhvhmFMohZgRsSUiulKIEeIg.jpg", "actors": ["Orson Welles (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
