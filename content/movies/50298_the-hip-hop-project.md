The film traces the evolution of this award-winning outreach program developed by Kazi, a formerly homeless teenager turned youth mentor. After four years of collaboration, the group produced a powerful and thought-provoking album that provides a revealing look at their lives. In contrast to all the negative attention focused on hip hop and rap music, this is a story of hope, healing and the realization of dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3G2wAJVGxTVpLae1uiI3VRwwOVn.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Willis (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
