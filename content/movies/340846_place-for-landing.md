A child and its reflection are inscribed in a shadowy lunar patchwork. The camera switches its optical pursuit: the child disappears and a bird emerges. The surveying mirror implodes or explodes into space. Its mottled hallway glass both indicates and becomes a PLACE FOR LANDING. After a series of clever misdirections by the mirror, all is redeemed by a fragment of song in this unsettling haptic illusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/laiBT1eqo9kAa2fcsQfoIH5HHpp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
