Both these and several victims are dug up by modern archaeologist Harrison 'Harry' McColl's expedition. Despite a cryptic warning from tribal locals, everything goes to his Colorado university's museum. It's all exhibited during another eclipse, which leads to the monster reviving. Harry and some of his friends must try to petrify the monster again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aobNw49wX1vlUD6dG30tkUrEgep.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy London (Dr. Harrison 'Harry' McColl)", "Wendy Carter (Rachel Donegal)", "Cleavant Derricks (Col.
