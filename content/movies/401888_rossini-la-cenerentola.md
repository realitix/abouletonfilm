And it's not just the two headliners; listen, for example, to the entrance of the stepsisters at the beginning of Act One. Nevertheless, some viewers may find the staging problematic, with singers in clown-like costumes and sets featuring human-sized rodents. Those seeking a more conventional production might want to consider the Houston Grand Opera DVD, also on Decca, with Cecilia Bartoli and Raul Jimenez. Both sets are wonderful, but, for me, Joyce Didonato and Juan Diego Florez are slightly to be preferred. Highly recommended.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3fWglKr9VymgjbU5WaZsE9MJMRt.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez (Don Ramiro)", "Joyce DiDonato (Angelina)", "Bruno de Simone (Don Magnifico)", "Cristina Obreg\u00f3n (Clorinda)", "Sim\u00f3n Orfila (Alidoro)", "David Men\u00e9ndez (Dandini)", "Itxaro Mentxaka (Tisbe)", "Patrick Summers (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
