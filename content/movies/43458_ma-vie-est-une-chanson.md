We see the fruits of Hart and Rodgers' collaboration - elaborately staged numbers from their plays, characters' visits to night clubs, and impromptu performances at parties. We also see Larry's scattered approach to life, his failed love with Peggy McNeil, his unhappiness, and Richard's successful wooing of Dorothy Feiner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/65AJ2VJegPIZDwSrGZLASnFlNlV.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Drake (Richard Rodgers)", "Mickey Rooney (Lorenz Hart)", "Janet Leigh (Dorothy Feiner Rodgers)", "Marshall Thompson (Herbert Fields)", "Betty Garrett (Peggy Lorgan McNeil)", "Jeanette Nolan (Mrs. Hart)", "Ann Sothern (Joyce Harmon)", "Perry Como (Eddie Lorrison Anders)", "Cyd Charisse (Margo Grant)", "Richard Quine (Ben Feiner Jr.)", "June Allyson (Alisande La Carteloise)", "Judy Garland (Herself)", "Lena Horne (Herself)", "Gene Kelly (Himself)", "Vera-Ellen (Herself)", "Mel Torm\u00e9 (Himself)", "Clinton Sundberg (Shoe Clerk)", "Dee Turnell (Dee Turnell)", "Edward Earle (James Fernby Kelly)", "Harry Antrim (Dr. Rogers)", "Ilka Gr\u00fcning (Mrs. Rogers)", "Emory Parnell (Mr. Feiner)", "Ramon Blackburn (One of the Blackburn Twins)", "Royce Blackburn (One of the Blackburn Twins)", "Dick Haymes (Dick Haymes)", "Dorothy Abbott (Showgirl (uncredited))", "Irving Bacon (Hollywood Realtor (uncredited))", "Gower Champion (Specialty Dancer (uncredited))", "Gino Corrado (Italian Waiter (uncredited))", "Jeanne Coyne (Showgirl (uncredited))", "Frank Mayo (Minor Role (uncredited))", "George Meeker (Producer (uncredited))", "Bert Moorhouse (Backstage Well-Wisher (uncredited))", "Allyn Ann McLerie (Singer in Garrick Gaeities)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [43792, 120862, 160660], "youtube_key": "kYMp7lKihSk"}
