When she suddenly collapses during the holidays, Hetty is hospitalized.  Feeling homesick and alone, she begins to re-evaluate her relationships and her accomplishments in life.  The story takes place against the backdrop of World War I as the King family prepares for its traditional Christmas dinner.  The reunion is marred by the fact that one of its youngest members, Felix, is missing in action; making differences of opinion about the war effort glaringly obvious.  This wonderful and accomplished cast comes together in an uplifting drama that illustrates the frailty of life and the importance of strength of family in turbulent times.\r (from DVD liner notes)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nWSGvPPDbieeIuk8jsMYZh9Dg4x.jpg", "actors": ["Jackie Burroughs (Hetty King)", "Lally Cadeau (Janet King)", "Lally Cadeau (Olivia Dale)", "Mag Ruffman (Alec King)", "Zachary Bennett (Felix King)", "Patricia Hamilton (Rachel Lynde)", "Gema Zamprogna (Felicity Pike)", "Molly Atkinson (Cecily King)", "Ryan Cooley (Daniel King)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
