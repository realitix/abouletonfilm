Malli works to help her parents collect firewood and plays with her best friend, the deaf and mute daughter of a middle class family. She longs for two things in this world: a new bright yellow dress and a magical blue bead that purportedly will restore her friend's hearing. Depicted with a surreal, occasionally nightmarish texture, the film lyrically shows both the easy friendships and bitter disappointments of childhood and the power of the imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Cxj6jC8dpFTwkxXHl1mjxQ5FZS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
