In them, one sees slices of Americana, discovers the world of educational cinema (with a language all its own), and gains an insight into the hopes and fears of the parents and educators who relied on the power of cinema to initiate, educate and indoctrinate the young.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7QTj5eptThqtz8FaeF6y0KU3pfE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
