A man loves a woman; both of them love literature. We discover the murmur of their lives, the harmony of their feelings\u2014and we learn how their affection for novels and poetry marks their existence beyond death. The fruitful alliance of filmmaker F\u00e9lix Dufour-Laperri\u00e8re\u2019s imagery and the words of Quebec poet H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dorion results in a subtle, sensitive film that resonates in the viewer\u2019s heart and mind. In its hybridization of styles and techniques, The Day Is Listening is also a most modern and daring work: its director has deftly expanded the spectrum of traditional hand-drawn animation, incorporating mosaics of real images that express a myriad of intertwining memories as well as the pulse of urban life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8V8C103FhUWY1DOkGQ3DVgnvtVy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
