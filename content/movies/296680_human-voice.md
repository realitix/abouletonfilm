Set against the backdrop of Naples, Italy, in 1950, this romantic drama tells the story of Angela, (played by Sophia Loren), a woman in the twilight of her years who rides the emotional roller coaster of her last telephone conversation with the man she loves as he is leaving her for another woman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4sPbPQtVZZCIV4xAnUJuzJiN5JJ.jpg", "actors": ["Sophia Loren ()", "Enrico Lo Verso ()", "Alessandra Bonarotta ()", "Virginia Da Brescia ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "This was a real treat for me. I didn't previously realize, before watching Sophia Loren's interview about 'A Special Day' (both that interview and 'Human Voice' are extras on The Criterion Collection release for that film) that this was a beloved role and film that actresses, as they got older, wanted to perform. I also didn't know about this play, despite being a Jean Cocteau enthusiast. This is the first film I have seen directed by Ponti, the son of Loren and the famous producer, Carlo Ponti. His work here is top-notch, especially the cinematography, and I can't for the life of me believe that Loren is 79-80 years old when this was filmed. I don't know her secret Fountain of Youth, but I for one will definitely have what she's having, as we tend to say. I exquisitely hope this isn't the last we've seen of the legendary thespian, but it's definitely worthy of, as she said in the aforementioned interview, the third-best performance she feels she has ever made."}], "recommandations_id": [100605], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
