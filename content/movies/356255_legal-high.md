There were other male students on the roof when Kazuhiko Kogure fell off. According to the other students there, Kazuhiko Kogure tried to jump to another school building, but missed. Fortunately, Kazuhiko Kogure only fractured his leg and ribs. According to Kazuhiko Kogure's mother Hidemi, the school insists it was students playing around and did not involve bullying. Hidemi though, doesn't believe it, because Kazuhiko Kogure has a fear of heights. Hidemi goes to see attorney Machiko Mayuzumi (Yui Aragaki) and Machiko decides to take her case, but she asks for fellow attorney Kensuke Komikado's (Masato Sakai) help. Meanwhile, the school hires attorney Teshigahara Isao (Kinya Kitaoji).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1vtuBs3ZbRlUkTh4YBDf1j5YwTk.jpg", "actors": ["Masato Sakai (Komikado Kensuke)", "Yui Aragaki (Mayuzumi Machiko)", "Katsuhisa Namase (Miki Chouichirou)", "Eiko Koike (Sawachi Kimie)", "Junnosuke Taguchi (Kaga Ranmaru)", "Nana Eikura (Fujii Minami)", "Ryoko Hirosue (Beppu Toshiko)", "Kinya Kitaoji (Teshigawara Isao)", "Kotaro Satomi (Hattori)", "Keiko Horiuchi (Kogure Hidemi)", "Takuto Sueoka (Kogure Kazuhiko)", "Tomoki Okayama (Aoyama Shun)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
