Is concerned with the texts of the publicist Eike Geisel (1945-1997). At the center are Geisel's criticisms of German remembrance politics and his thesis on the \"reparation of the Germans\". Texts by Geisel from the 1990s, including the Neue Wache and the Holocaust memorial in Berlin, contrast with today's pictures of the memorial sites described. They show a normality that does not really exist.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Henryk M.
