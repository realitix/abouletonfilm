Paco's life is told in flashbacks by a priest (Antonio Ferrandis) who is seen officiating at an anniversary mass attended by three wealthy landowners and no one else. The priest recalls Paco's baptism, his communion, his marriage ceremony and then his work for the peasants as he advocated and led them in a land-reform movement. The rest of the story will rest heavy on the priest's conscience, as he looks out at his empty church.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sOg2M1Bk47p74zsa99MTtrmUF8h.jpg", "actors": ["Antonio Banderas (Paco)", "Terele P\u00e1vez (Jer\u00f3nima)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [102492, 215597, 67815, 102512], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
