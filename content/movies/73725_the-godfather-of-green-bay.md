A fifteen-year comedy veteran who was pegged for stardom early on in his career but has blown every major audition he has ever had in legendary fashion. Fresh off a recent fiasco with a heckler that included a broken nose, Joe's friend Kenny tells him he can get them an audition for 'The Tonight Show' and that it's 'a can't miss.' The one catch is that it's at a roadside bar in tiny Pine Lake, Wisconsin, hometown of Tonight Show Talent scout, Harvey Skorik who never misses 'Rocktoberfest.' Having doubts but needing a break from L.A., Joe reluctantly agrees to go. Arriving in Wisconsin, Joe bombs his first night on stage when local emcee Dug sabotages him. Joe cannot get a break until he encounters his former high school English teacher, the beautiful Molly Mahoney who is also at a crossroads in her life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4GRJTGdjwcPdgyfurkr6DChcIMb.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Goldwyn (Big Jake Norquist)", "Lauren Holly (Molly Mahoney)", "Jimmy Pardo (Higgins)", "Thomas Lennon (DUG)", "Pete Schwaba (Joe Keegan)", "Lance Barber (Kenny Caruso)", "Brian Cashen (Heckler)", "Donna Brower (Heckler's Mother)", "Gary Brichetto (Lou)", "Robert Martin (Slugs)", "Ivona Rocque (Tonya)", "Steve Seagren (Ralphy)", "Eric Price (Ratboy)", "Mark Borchardt (Skeeter)", "Mike Siegel (Driver)", "Johnny Starks (Marcus)", "Jessica Koosed (Waitress)", "Tracy Thorpe (Janice)", "Dennis LaValle (Harvey Skorik)", "Duane Sharp (Sheriff)", "Paul Bentzen (Farmer (uncredited))", "Roberto Soto (Dupar's Manager (uncredited))", "Adam Wills (Heckler (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
