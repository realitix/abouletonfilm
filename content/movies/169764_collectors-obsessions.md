The team of the Collectors have visited a variety of different people from across the country, each with their fascinating collection that ranges from impressive to downright ridiculous. However, one man's junk is another man's treasure which is a strong theme of the series. For example, some of the people showcases in this series involve a collection for body parts which include navel fluff and even pubic hair. Others collect religious objects to colour charts and the like, proving that anything is collectable. Truly a unique insight into his obsession that some of us take beyond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/omatpGnOxGlJzlSCmassdI3WfMM.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Muirhead ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
