This 'musical burlesque' tells about a stylish young gentleman (Willi Forst) who works as a so-called 'Festredner'; an untranslatable term, it indicates a person who makes speeches at important events like marriages etc. for people who don't feel able to do it themselves. Willi lends his voice to a speech-impaired professor (Paul H\u00f6rbiger), but the baroness (Trude Lieske) who falls in love with H\u00f6rbiger only does so because of Willi's voice, and you can guess that this leads to all sorts of complications\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ouhmnYEimgefiulu8DNBkWdrOK0.jpg", "actors": ["Willi Forst (Carry Clips, ein Festredner)", "Paul H\u00f6rbiger (Prof. Amanuel Wielander)", "Wilhelm Bendow (Dr. Cajetan)", "Else Elster (Lillebil)", "Trude Lieske (Frau Baronin Lindenw\u00f6rth)", "Elma Bulla (Titi)", "Henry Bender (Ein Schutzmann)", "Albert Paulig (Herr Hinzemann)", "Johanna Ewald (Frau Hinzemann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
