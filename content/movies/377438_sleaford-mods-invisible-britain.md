The film follows Sleaford Mods on a tour of the UK in the run up to the 2015 General Election, visiting the neglected, broken down and boarded up parts of the country that many would prefer to ignore. Part band doc, part look at the state of the nation, the documentary features individuals and communities attempting to find hope among the ruins, against a blistering soundtrack by Sleaford Mods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xW1gnIKyG4ILVy4DTsltjy3SEal.jpg", "actors": ["Andrew Tiernan (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PBkULCP-fPc"}
