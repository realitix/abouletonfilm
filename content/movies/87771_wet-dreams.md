When a female apprentice teacher, Ms. Kim Yoo-ri begins teaching at their all boys school, she captures the lust and imagination of four of her students, who cannot stop fantasizing about her.  Dong-hyuns secret 'love' for his teacher is shattered by news of her affections for another teacher Mr Gong. Yoo-ri has already fallen for the homeroom teacher, Mr Gong, and has her own daydreams about what it would be like with him.  Unfortunately, Mr Gong has forsaken love in his life, and is immune to her come-ons. Yoo-ri must get him to accept her advances, while rejecting the rapid-fire advance of her four students.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l1skme2RHSFm1c7ipdlR54mVfEq.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Sun-a (Yoo-ri)", "Lee Beom-soo (Mr Gong)", "No Hyeong-uk ()", "Jeon Jae-hyeong ()", "Jeong Dae-hoon ()", "Park Yong-sik ()", "Kim Ae-kyung ()", "Kim Jong-min ()", "Kim Gi-yeon ()", "Park Soo-in ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
