In Unstoppable Solar Cycles, Dr. Willie Soon and Dr. David Legates challenge the popular idea that human-generated CO2, is causing catastrophic global warming.  These scientists propose an alterantive theory - that the current warming has more to do with solar activity than with human activity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qYASGSBwRPkygjdVFWf1L0bDLqE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
