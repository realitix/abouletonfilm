Block opens the show with Freddie Martin's first big hit, \"Tonight We Love,\" an adaption of a Tchaikovsky piano concerto; he dedicates it to a listener in Wyoming, and we see her daydreaming as she listens. Then Keenan Wynn stops in for a chat, asking Block about being a DJ. Between bits of conversation with Wynn, Block plays three more Martin records, including \"Cumana,\" and we see the band in action.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
