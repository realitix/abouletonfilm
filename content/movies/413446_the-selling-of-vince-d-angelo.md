In the process he spreads vicious rumors about his running mates and uses incendiary campaign commercials to get himself elected. His campaign is derailed when he is caught-on-tape giving a bribe to a G-man posing as a mobster. His response to the \"Mobscam\" debacle is to claim he was \"conducting his own investigation\" and then fakes an 11th hour assassination on himself to engender voter sympathy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a609GNja5GdMAx6Fc7FoF6uzwSV.jpg", "actors": ["Danny DeVito (Vince D'Angelo)", "Rhea Perlman (Vince's Wife)", "Vincent Schiavelli (Vince's Right Hand Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
