There is also a wonderful scene where a trio of gents have gathered to naked naughty pictures and whilst the gorgeous Yuki Sumida is quite naked, there are fully dressed and wearing decorative and rather spooky masks. It is a bitter sweet tale of  an older writer and his flings with ladies of the night, culminating with a more regular relationship with the aforementioned Ms Sumida. Very well told with lots of Tokyo period detail and very much skin. Frequent and graceful are the sexual bouts ensure there is never a dull moment and a colourful and thoughtful story excellently portrayed by Shindo."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
