With the decadence of 1920's Berlin, but all in a muddy field. A film of the dark, self-destructive side of creativity and the personal trauma behind it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oN7CtIAxKrmFEJ4L1dUt82pm6Fr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
