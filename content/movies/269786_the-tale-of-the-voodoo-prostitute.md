One particular female managed to meet and exceed any expectation of evil. She cursed Fleetwood to a fate even worse than death: impotence. With his harem of beautiful women and killers, Fleetwood must rival neighboring pimps to free himself from a curse that if left undone would not only take his manhood, but possibly his life. This film is based in the mean streets and interminglings of the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3CRbipGO5sVe8sBUM9kqD7O8gsC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
