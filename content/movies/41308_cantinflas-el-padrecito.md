The newcomer gradually earns the trust of the people through humor, but firmly captures their hearts by saving the town fiesta by fighting a bull when the hired torero failed to show.Father Sebasti\u00e1n counsels the townspeople, lecturing them on their duties in a modern society. He used the collection plate to redistribute the town's wealth more evenly. When accused of communism, he quoted the 1891 socially-conscious encyclical Rerum Novarum. He even ventured into politics, with a veiled attack on the municipal president couched into a sermon. Eventually, he brokers a deal with the local political boss for some concessions for the poor of his parish.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Alt7xYb5mK6rl3Myy1LaHFuzSoy.jpg", "actors": ["Cantinflas (Padre Sebasti\u00e1n)", "\u00c1ngel Garasa (Padre Dam\u00edan)", "Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez (Sara)", "Jos\u00e9 El\u00edas Moreno (Don Silvestre)", "Rosa Mar\u00eda V\u00e1zquez (Susana)", "Rogelio Guerra (Marcos)", "Florencio Castell\u00f3 (Don Nicanor)", "Jorge Russek (Mat\u00edas)", "Arturo Castro 'Bigot\u00f3n' (Nepomuceno)", "Gerardo del Castillo (Mujeriego)", "Armando Guti\u00e9rrez (Presidente municipal)", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Moreno (Joven)", "Alfonso Torres (Don Felipe)", "Mary Montiel (Novia de joven)", "Alberto Catal\u00e1 (Droguero)", "Elodia Hern\u00e1ndez (Mujer de Pueblo)", "Alberto Gal\u00e1n (Padre Juan Jos\u00e9 Romero)", "Cecilia Leger (Mujer de Pueblo)", "Ren\u00e9 Barrera (Villano)", "Queta Carrasco (Vecina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [45191, 41004, 69057, 41300], "youtube_key": "_EpMLP6HZfM"}
