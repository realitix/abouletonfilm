Interwoven into that transformation in fashion and style of the ao dai in modern times told through the story of the character of Ba. Audiences will also see somewhere the image of the 60s, 70s full of honest women. An image of Saigon in the past, gentle and steeped in contrast to the rush of a dynamic city will be described by fashion, namely long dress - traditional costumes in Vietnam. All of them are cleverly nested in the story between two families, between mothers and their children, between a tailor and a fabric shop filled with dramatic rage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kt0BXKtgMg62B8GRBnd9X7dDaWx.jpg", "actors": ["Ninh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Lan Ng\u1ecdc (Nh\u01b0 \u00dd)", "H\u1ed3ng V\u00e2n (An Kh\u00e1nh)", "Veronica Ngo (Thanh Mai)", "Di\u1ec5m My 9x (Helen)", "S.T 365 (Tu\u1ea5n)", "Di\u1ec5m My (Old Thanh Loan)", "oanh ki\u1ec1u (Young Thanh Loan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "C4J_9BJy6gY"}
