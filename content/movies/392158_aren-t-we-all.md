While Margot, an actress, goes to a small resort where she will not be recognized, Kitty Lake, one of the young women Lord Grenham pursues, flirts with Willie. Two weeks pass and when Willie tells Margot on the telephone that he must stay in town, she threatens to engage in a violent flirtation with the next attractive man she sees. Karl von der Heide, from Vienna, who is waiting to use the telephone, overhears her and begins a flirtation. She identifies herself to him as Mrs. Margaret Spaulding, and they pursue the beginnings of a romance until Margot suddenly returns home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sanT31GVDWf3FTwrbUc6Huj6Vxy.jpg", "actors": ["Gertrude Lawrence (Margot)", "Hugh Wakefield (Lord Grenham)", "Owen Nares (Willie)", "Wallace Geoffrey (Robert Kent)", "Harold Huth (Karl Van der Hyde)", "Marie Lohr (Lady Frinton)", "Renee Gadd (Kitty Lake)", "Emily Fitzroy (Angela)", "Aubrey Mather (Vicar)", "Rita Page (Cabaret Dancer)", "Maud Gill (Bit Part)", "Kathleen Harrison (Bit Role)", "Eileen Munro (Bit Part)", "Merle Oberon (Bit Part)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
