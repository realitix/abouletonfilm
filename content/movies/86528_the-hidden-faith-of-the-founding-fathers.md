Many founders were involved in secret societies, and yet it is often claimed these men were Christians who were trying to build a Christian nation. But was their faith the true faith of the Bible? And is it possible, as some claim, that the exact opposite is true?  What did the founders believe about the Person of Jesus Christ? Were they fighting for Christianity, or against it? Moreover, is it possible that the events of the American Revolution have a much darker significance in the pages of Bible prophecy than most church leaders are aware?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qPFu75BKz8kqHa3GH8nvNSQ9Ivl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
