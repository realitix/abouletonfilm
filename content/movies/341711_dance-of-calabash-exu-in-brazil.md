Alongside other Yoruba Gods, Exu was brought to Brazil by the slaves and became demonized during the colonial period, when catholic missions in Africa and in Brazil concealed its original attributes. In Africa, Exu was viewed as the beginning of life, the force that moved bodies, the lord of the paths and cross-roads. It was the main link between the dead and the gods. For the Christians, it became the personification of evil, due to its falic symbol and astute behaviour. Directed by Kiko Dinucci, the movie investigates the different African-brazilian religions, such as candombl\u00e9 (Nag\u00f4, Gege and Bantu traditions), Tambor de Mina, Umbanda and Quimbanda. Special appearances of priests, clergyman and scholars.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3G247hixVfr23XNQRvFOhRMjcnc.jpg", "actors": ["Reginaldo Prandi ()", "Marta Helo\u00edsa Leuba Salum ()", "Iya Sandra Medeiros Epega ()", "Adejimi Aderotimi Adefolurin ()", "Carlos Alberto de Camargo de Oxum ()", "Vodunnon Francelino de Shapanan ()", "Egbonmi Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Reis de Ogum ()", "Taw\u00e1 Joselito da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o ()", "Walmir Katuvanjesi Damasceno ()", "Rita de Cassia Cordeiro ()", "Milton Alves dos Santos ()", "Jos\u00e9 Enis de Jesus ()", "Elias de Andrade Pinto ()", "Gilberto Ferreira de Ex\u00fa ()", "Antonio Katulem Burange de Amorim ()", "Jo\u00e3o Lamburancimbe ()", "Daran Suru ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
