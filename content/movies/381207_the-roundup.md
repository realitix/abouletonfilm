This confused mess, the first cinematic attempt at portraying the Greek resistance in WWII, caused quite a stink upon release, as much for its surprising style (recalling that of Bertolt Brecht) as for its subject matter. Reaction to its screening as part of the 1966 Cannes Film Festival's International Critic's Week was heated and divisive, proving Kyrou's later statement by rising above its own inherent silliness to achieve a sort of rarefied critical status. It's bad drama that nonetheless succeeds by dint of audacity more than quality (a comment which could apply equally to the work of many exploitation directors like Jean Rollin whom Kyrou later so lovingly profiled).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3FnJ129P5fl0Tv6l9LHpFPvziws.jpg", "actors": ["Kostas Kazakos (Kosmas)", "Xenia Kalogeropoulou (Antigoni)", "Alexandra Ladikou (Myrto)", "Giannis Fertis ()", "Manos Katrakis ()", "Kostas Bakas ()", "Koula Agagiotou ()", "Giannis Kondoulis ()", "Eirini Koumarianou ()", "Giorgos Nezos ()", "Hristos Bekiaris ()", "Kostas Diplaros ()", "Theodoros Dovas ()", "Maria Giourousi ()", "Christoforos Himaras ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
