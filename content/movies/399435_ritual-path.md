The blending of beautiful natural settings from all over the world with the latest techniques in computer morphing and editing to create marvelous suggestive and evocative scenes in flowing transformation is the closest you can come to a psychedelic experience without physically inducing one. In fact, at one point I found myself in a genuinely altered state of consciousness just watching the screen. The music is beautifully rendered and keyed to the visual progressions---much like, but better than, Disney's Fantasia. One reviewer asked what he could do with it. I would suggest using the \"Loop\" option on a widescreen t.v. as a party background, but you are liable to have many of your guests quietly glued to the t.v. set rather than partying. It's that good. Also don't miss the \"Blue Eye\" option. This is an audio-visual feast and tour d'force.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yWc0xr6L7Y2uB9p8XPZaJZ7WI2U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
