Their dashing, daredevil leader is the mysterious \"Red Shadow\". Margot Bonvalet, a lovely, sassy French girl, is soon to be married at the fort to Birabeau's right-hand man, Captain Fontaine. Birabeau's son Pierre, in reality the Red Shadow, loves Margot, but pretends to be a milksop to preserve his secret identity. Margot tells Pierre that she secretly yearns to be swept into the arms of some bold, dashing sheik, perhaps even the Red Shadow himself. Pierre, as the Red Shadow, kidnaps Margot and declares his love for her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aamaKU3xrqXCk0IKiktDjiSWt55.jpg", "actors": ["John Boles (The Red Shadow)", "Carlotta King (Margot)", "Louise Fazenda (Susan)", "Johnny Arthur (Benny Kidd)", "Edward Martindel (General Bierbeau)", "Jack Pratt (Pasha)", "Roberto E.
