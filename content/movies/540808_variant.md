The film\u2019s speed suggests the idea of an impermanent flux, attempting to create a transient, felt experience. Variant \u201cpushes to experiential and formal extremes the deployment of schematic and repetitive structures.\u201d (Federico Windhausen)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sRtaqFC5KctDB6wH91pzmiQOxzI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
