A British bulldog answers his mistress's call. He tacks down the Union Jack to cover the British Isles, then begins playing with a small ball that's the world. At first it's innocent play. The dog discovers tea in India; then, the dog shakes gold out of Africa. Gradually, innocence gives way to more and more ferocious play with the ball. We see terrorized women and children as the dog becomes an enslaving potentate. Harmless English archetypes benefit from colonial riches. Then the world begins to grow, and the dog changes too, from bulldog to effete lap dog.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s7BSgsmCuI3heHdQtXIVeIldrhf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
