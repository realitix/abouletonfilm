It can be seen as an answer to the challenge posed by River Elegy: how to envision a new Chinese destiny founded on principles of individuality, creativity, discovery, and freedom. The film also reflects the contemporary condition of the virtual supplanting our experience of the real.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g0o5pWJlWY8jWo6HQAurF7wTV2D.jpg", "actors": ["Cao Fei (China Tracy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5vcR7OkzHkI"}
