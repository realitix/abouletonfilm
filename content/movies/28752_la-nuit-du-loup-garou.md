As an adult, Leon (Oliver Reed) leaves his adoptive parents to work at a nearby winery and develops a relationship with the owner\u2019s highborn daughter (Catherine Feller). Unfortunately, an animal spirit seeks to dominate his soul as he struggles to suppress the beast within.\r\n\r\nThe only werewolf flick made by Hammer, \u201cThe Curse of the Werewolf\u201d (1961) was based on the novel \u201cThe Werewolf of Paris\u201d by Guy Endore, but the location of the story was switched from France to Spain because there was a Spanish set available after a film about the Spanish Inquisition was scrapped due to opposition from the Catholic League of Decency.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting that Oliver Reed doesn\u2019t even appear until the movie is past half over with only 45 minutes remaining (not counting his eyes in the opening credits). Reed had that gripping Brando-like brooding magnetism and his mounting anguish is displayed well. We realize Leon\u2019s innocent, but in the grip of some kind of curse unjustly thrust upon him.\r\n\r\nThe movie is unassuming and has the confidence to take its time with the entire first half being a set-up, which some modern viewers find boring and extraneous. But watch closely and there are several gems to be gleaned. For instance, Leon\u2019s name is the reverse of Noel and it is love that keeps the fiend within at bay, whether paternal love or romantic love. The pure affection of Cristina is the only answer to soothe the savage beast, but she\u2019s kept from him. The fools.\r\n\r\nThe setting of 18th century Spain makes for a nice change of pace in a Hammer flick; and the look of the iconic creature itself was unique at the time and very effective, partially due to Reed\u2019s brawny appearance and heavy charm.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in England (Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Surrey).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [3104, 34479, 23220, 3079]}
