The one-hour program (plus 40 minutes of bonus interview material on the DVD) combines performance footage (the early TV shows are not to be missed), photos, and more to limn Presley's early days, when he combined country, blues, and R&amp;B to forge a unique, galvanizing style. Sun producer Sam Phillips, author Peter Guralnick, Presley's musicians, and others are on hand to provide insight and background. But in the end, of course, it comes down to the music--and when you're talking about the likes of \"Blue Suede Shoes,\" \"Tutti Frutti,\" \"Money Honey,\" and \"Heartbreak Hotel\" (a single that actually wasn't on the album), \"classic\" hardly begins to cover it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hrYpLOQZiNlS4bfIBnpzFIrjF4Q.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Presley (Himself (archive footage))", "Dixie Locke Emmons (Herself (as Dixie Locke))", "Peter Guralnick (Himself)", "Ernst Jorgensen (Himself)", "B.B.
