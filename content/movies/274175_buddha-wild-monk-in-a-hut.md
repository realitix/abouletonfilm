The beautiful Anna Wilding captures the essence of joy with effortless flair.  Beautifully filmed, one walks away from Buddha Wild with vivid, memorable images etched in their mind.  I have actually watched this film, end to end, four times.  Each time, I come away with little details I didn't catch before.  A great introduction for anyone first discovering Asian cultures, and equally satisfying for those well versed in Buddhism.  It plays brilliantly on the big screen, but is also compelling on DVD."}], "recommandations_id": []}
