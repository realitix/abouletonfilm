Weiley's film was controversial; it was screened once and then he was told it had been destroyed. Forty five years later a copy was discovered in the BBC vaults by an ABC producer looking for archive footage of the Opera House. Weiley was contacted and told about a film that had no sound track. Weiley was overjoyed; for years he had kept the original sound. So began the painstaking process of restoring this record of a unique moment in Australian culture to its former glory, complete with updated voice-over from the original narrator, Bob Ellis. It is set in context by a 30 minute prologue entitled 'The Dream of Perfection'. Made by the same filmmaker, John Weiley, forty-five years on, 'Dream of Perfection' tells the story of the 1968 film - from commission to destruction, to surprise resurrection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nymDm0Y5mYWEPA6hiyhuubHBUc9.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Ellis (Narrator)", "John Weiley (Himself)", "Jan Utzon (Himself)", "Lin Utzon (Himself)", "Jorn Utzon (Himself)", "Richard le Plaistrier (Himself)", "David Attenborough (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oSkJpRpB7iQ"}
