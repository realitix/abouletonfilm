Within one family, the younger son is jealous of the praise his father gives to a Polish POW who is working for them under very difficult conditions. Within the village as a whole, the French, Polish, and Russian POWs are kept under guard by Nazi soldiers, creating a tense situation all around. But more importantly, the village has conspired to hide an Austrian deserter in a cave up in the mountains. This act of rebellion on the part of the deserter and the village hangs in a precarious balance that could be upset by a single traitorous comment to the Gestapo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uPhKNAiaLdRVwj4P3rXqlxIWKcP.jpg", "actors": ["Florian Pircher (Santner)", "Albert Paulus (Ruap)", "Helmut Vogel (Jacek)", "Rolf Zacher (Aufseher)", "Claus-Dieter Reents (Gestapomann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
