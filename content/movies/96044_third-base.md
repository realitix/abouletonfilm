In this story, Third (Toshiyuki Nagashima) is an aimless young man who hangs around with a couple of girls who are amateur hookers. One day, while acting as their pimp, he gets into a conflict with a young gangster and winds up killing him. He is caught for this crime and imprisoned. Even here, because he is not a proper gangster, he is an outsider.  ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hVfcqh2OTrGgaJQraalzqs7BmgD.jpg", "actors": ["Toshiyuki Nagashima ()", "Tsuguaki Yoshida ()", "Aiko Morishita ()", "Akiko Shikata ()", "Y\u016bko Katagiri (Woman with red sweater)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [420687, 30518], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
