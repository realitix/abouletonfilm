The composer took three years to complete the work, which, for him, marked a new stylish departure. With more modern harmonic combinations and local melodies, Puccini pieced together a far larger canvas than anything he had tackled before. In this recording, Piero Faggioni's highly detailed staging is matched by Ken Adam's superbly atmospheric sets. Carol Neblett sings the role of Minnie \"The Girl of the Gold West,\" Placido Domingo is as ignitable as ever in the role of Dick Johnson, alias the bandit, Ramirez, and Silvano Carroli sings the sinister sheriff, Jack Rance. Conducted by Nello Santi.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yaNB7Ty8Yhu0xekJrrd490OscTG.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Dick Johnson)", "Carol Neblett (Minnie)", "Silvano Carroli (Jack Rance)", "Robert Lloyd (Ashby)", "John Rawnsley (Sonora)", "Gwynne Howell (Jake Wallace)", "John Dobson (Trin)", "Norman Welsby (Sid)", "Francis Egerton (Nick)", "Tom McDonell (Bello)", "Paul Crook (Harry)", "Robin Leggate (Joe)", "Ian Caddy (Happy)", "Paul Hudson (Billy Jackrabbit)", "John Gibbs (Jos\u00e9 Castro)", "Nello Santi (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
