A family. A perfectly normal wish and precisely because it is so easy, but not so easy to fulfill today. So what do you do when one partner wants a child and the other one maybe does or in fact doesn't? Split up? What does a child mean for a relationship? What does the wish and the urging do to a relationship? A relationship which works so easily, just as long as neither half really wants something. Sabine makes a decision and Michael can finally say what he feels.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
