In 1940, Britain's gold reserves were transferred for safety to Liverpool because of the threat of a German invasion. The top-secret operation was known only to a handful of security men and senior bank officials... and a group of Liverpool dockers who handle the move. Billy Mac, the dockers' leader, hatches an ingenious plan to steal some of the gold bars from under the noses of the guards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nJVmVIM1KD3GxsggqYnFTnvRa5E.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Billy Mac)", "Tim Pigott-Smith (Hubert)", "Gorden Kaye (Nickson)", "Brenda Blethyn (Gwen)", "Geoffrey Hutchings (Barton)", "Noreen Kershaw (Mrs Mac)", "Stephen Lord (Alf)", "Neil Caple (Jacko)", "Paul Angelis (Destry)", "Jack Deam (Richard)", "Susannah Corbett (Judith)", "Colin Edwynn (Chips)", "Christopher Quinn (Adam)", "Al Hunter Ashton (Barnstable)", "Stephen Hancock (Peters)", "Bill Speed (Stan)", "David Pugh (Ivor)", "Antony Brown (Sir John Anderson)", "Tony Caron (Watson)", "Ifan Huw Dafydd (Carlos)", "Chris Lang (Frederickson)", "Suzanne Hitchmough (Maureen)", "Stephen Hall (William)", "Barbara Halliwell (Vi)", "Ken Sharrock (Arthur)", "Rynagh O'Grady (Mrs O'Brian)", "Gerry White (George)", "Ray Williams (Kenny)", "James Culshaw (Greengrocer)", "Al T.
