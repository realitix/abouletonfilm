Sylvia undergoes a horrifying physical transformation, and she finds herself drawn into a persecuted underworld where she begins an astonishing journey of freakish self-discovery. Marker is a classic coming-of-age tale with a horror twist, which pits its heroine against her oppressors - the town's non-afflicted - in a battle for self-determination--and survival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pvd25SeI9kLKB7MVYFBXyu8TSBK.jpg", "actors": ["Iris Graham (Sylvia)", "Jonathan Cherry (Spumoni Agnellos)", "Philip Granger (Joe)", "Eric Johnson (Roddy Dutch)", "Sonja Bennett (Kim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
